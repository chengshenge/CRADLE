  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes point labels A through H and specifically marks angle H. The measure of angle H is directly provided in the diagram as 102 degrees. The task is to confirm this measure and map it to the correct multiple-choice option. The problem is straightforward as the necessary information is visually available in the diagram.",
