  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a set of 50 objects, among which there are 15 large rubber spheres and 10 big shiny cylinders. The task is to subtract the number of large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem is presented in a textual format, and the necessary numerical values are provided within the text. The solution requires basic arithmetic operations to find the remaining number of objects.",
