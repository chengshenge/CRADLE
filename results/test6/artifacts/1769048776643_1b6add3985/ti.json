  "problem_state_summary": "A cumin canister with a mass of 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter at a speed of 0.50 m/s. It collides with a spring that has a spring constant of 750 N/m, causing the spring to compress. The task is to determine the distance 'd' by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped. The problem involves the conversion of the canister's kinetic energy into the potential energy stored in the spring. The setup is likely depicted in a diagram showing the canister, the spring, and the compression distance 'd'. The solution requires calculating the compression distance using the given physical parameters.",
