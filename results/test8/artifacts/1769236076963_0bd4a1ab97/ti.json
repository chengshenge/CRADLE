  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram that contains various objects, including spheres and cylinders with different attributes. The task is to determine the number of objects left after removing all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the image. The problem requires identifying specific objects based on their attributes such as size, material, and shape. The subtraction operation is needed to find the remaining count of objects. The diagram includes labels for 'large rubber sphere' and 'big shiny cylinder', which are crucial for identifying the objects to be subtracted. The exact definition of 'large' and 'big' in terms of size is not provided, which may require visual judgment.",
