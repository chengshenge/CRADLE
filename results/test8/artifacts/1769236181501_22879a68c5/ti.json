  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves interpreting a clock diagram to determine the time shown. The clock face is a geometric figure with hands indicating hours and minutes. The task is to express the time in words using the given multiple-choice options. The problem specifically asks for the time word that fits the phrase '(_) after eight.' The clock face is marked with labels at 12, 3, 6, and 9 positions. The exact position of the clock hands needs to be interpreted to choose the correct time word. The answer must be provided as a word from the given options and the corresponding option letter.",
