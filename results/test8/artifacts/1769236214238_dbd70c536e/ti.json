  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a spatial arrangement depicted in a diagram, where the task is to compare the number of tiny gray bicycles located on the left side of a brown metal sedan with the number of objects positioned to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The question asks whether the former quantity is greater than the latter. The diagram is expected to show these objects and their relative positions, which are crucial for solving the problem. The task requires counting and comparing these specific objects based on their spatial arrangement. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'.",
