  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence, which suggests a pattern recognition task likely involving shapes or diagrams. The task is to determine which object follows a given sequence of objects, implying a pattern or rule must be identified from the visual elements. The sequence is presented in a diagram, and the options for the next object are labeled A to E. The problem requires analyzing the sequence to identify the pattern or rule governing the arrangement of objects. The correct option must be selected based on this analysis. The task is a logic-based problem, focusing on pattern recognition.",
