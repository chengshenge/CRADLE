  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes point labels A through H and angle labels corresponding to these points. The specific angle m∠H is marked with a value of 102 degrees in the diagram. The task is to confirm this measure and select the correct option from the given choices. The problem is straightforward as the value of m∠H is directly provided in the image. The choices provided are 97, 102, 107, and 122, and the correct answer must be mapped to one of these options.",
