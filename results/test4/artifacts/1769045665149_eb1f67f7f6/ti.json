  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence, which is presented as a diagram. The task is to determine which object follows a given sequence of objects, implying a pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence is not explicitly described, so the pattern must be inferred from the visual information. The diagram contains labels corresponding to the options provided: A, B, C, D, and E. The problem is a logic-based task requiring pattern recognition. The final answer must be one of the provided options.",
