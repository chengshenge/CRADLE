  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves interpreting a clock diagram to determine the time shown. The task is to find a time word that completes the sentence 'It is (_) after eight.' The clock face is a diagram with numbers indicating hours from 8 to 7. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the time word. The exact position of the clock hands needs to be interpreted to determine the correct time word. The time is known to be after eight, and the answer must fit this context.",
