  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a spatial arrangement depicted in a diagram where specific objects need to be counted and compared. The task is to determine if the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of a brown metal sedan is greater than the number of things to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The problem requires visual inspection to identify and count these objects accurately. The diagram includes a brown metal sedan, tiny gray bicycles, and a tiny green bicycle. The exact number of these objects and their positions are not provided in the text and must be determined from the image. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: Yes or No.",
