  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric diagram with points A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4.0 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the length of AC. The exact positions of points A, B, C, and D are not specified in the text, which may affect the interpretation of the diagram. The solution requires understanding the geometric relationship between the points and segments.",
