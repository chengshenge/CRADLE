  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a spatial arrangement depicted in a diagram. It requires comparing the number of tiny gray bicycles located on the left side of a brown metal sedan with the number of objects positioned to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The task is to determine which of these two quantities is greater. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The diagram is expected to contain visual elements such as a brown metal sedan, tiny gray bicycles, and a tiny green bicycle. The exact number of these objects and their positions need to be determined from the image to answer the question correctly.",
