  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The given information includes angle A, which measures 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the user prompt. The angle bisectors OB and OC divide angles B and C, respectively. The sum of angles A, B, and C in triangle ABC is 180 degrees. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the measure of angle BOC.",
