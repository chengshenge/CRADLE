  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric diagram with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4 cm and 7 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC using the given information. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options for the length of AC. The spatial relationships and segment lengths are crucial for solving the problem, and the diagram must be examined to understand these relationships.",
