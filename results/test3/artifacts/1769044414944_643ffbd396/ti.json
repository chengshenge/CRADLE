  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure known as a Pythagorean tree, which consists of squares and right triangles. In this configuration, all quadrilaterals are squares, and all triangles are right triangles. The areas of two squares, A and B, are given as 5 and 3 square units, respectively. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled C. This requires understanding the geometric relationships inherent in the Pythagorean tree, particularly how the areas of the squares relate to each other. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the area of square C.",
