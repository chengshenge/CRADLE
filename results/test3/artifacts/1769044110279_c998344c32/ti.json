  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup is depicted in a diagram with volume markings at 500 ml, 250 ml, 100 ml, and 50 ml. The task is to extract the total volume from these markings. The unit specified for the volume is grams (g), which is unusual and suggests careful interpretation of the image is needed. The problem is straightforward and requires reading the diagram to find the total volume. The question is presented in a multiple-choice format, requiring an integer answer.",
