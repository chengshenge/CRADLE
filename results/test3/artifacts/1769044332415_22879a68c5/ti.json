  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves interpreting the time shown on a clock face, which is presented as a diagram. The task is to determine the time word that fits the sentence 'It is (_) after eight.' The options provided are time-related terms such as 'half', 'quarter', 'o'clock', 'quarter to', and 'quarter past'. The clock face is a geometric shape with hands indicating time, and the exact position of the clock hands needs to be interpreted to determine the correct time word. The problem is multiple-choice, requiring the selection of the correct option label. The main challenge is accurately reading the clock hands to match the time with the provided options.",
