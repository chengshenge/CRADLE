  "problem_state_summary": "The problem presents two diagrams showing pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball in the diagrams represents one gas particle, and both samples have the same number of particles. The task is to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample and determine which sample has the higher temperature. The relationship between average kinetic energy and temperature is a key concept in this problem. The problem does not specify the type of gas or initial conditions, which may affect the interpretation. The answer must be selected from the given multiple-choice options.",
