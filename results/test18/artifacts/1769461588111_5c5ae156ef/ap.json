      "action": "reason",
      "note": "Average kinetic energy is directly related to temperature; higher kinetic energy means higher temperature."

      "intention": "Determine which sample has higher temperature",
      "action": "reason",
      "note": "Since both samples have the same number of particles and are in identical containers, the sample with higher kinetic energy has higher temperature."

      "intention": "Select the correct option based on kinetic energy",
      "action": "reason",
      "note": "If kinetic energies are visually identical, select option A; otherwise, select B or C based on which sample appears to have higher kinetic energy."
