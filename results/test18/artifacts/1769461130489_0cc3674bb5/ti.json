  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the number of objects left after subtracting specific types of objects based on their attributes. The attributes to consider are color, size, and material. Specifically, the task is to subtract all big red metallic spheres and all big brown matte things from a total number of objects. The image or text provides information about the total number of objects and the counts of specific types of objects. The goal is to compute how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem requires interpreting text labels or descriptions to identify the relevant objects. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
