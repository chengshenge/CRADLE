  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual task where specific objects need to be identified and subtracted based on their color, size, and material properties. The user is asked to subtract all red matte cubes and all small green metal objects from a total set of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem requires visual inspection of a diagram or image to accurately count and categorize the objects. The total number of objects before subtraction is given as 20. The counts for red matte cubes and small green metal objects are provided as 5 and 3, respectively.",
