  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a bar chart titled 'Monthly Sales Data' with the x-axis labeled as 'Month' and the y-axis labeled as 'Sales (in thousands)'. The chart displays sales data for the months of January through June. The task is to determine the difference between the largest and smallest values represented by the bars in this chart. The largest value is identified as 60, occurring in May, and the smallest value is 10, occurring in June. The problem requires extracting these values from the chart and performing a subtraction to find the difference. The final answer should be presented as a floating-point number with one decimal place.",
