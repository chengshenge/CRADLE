  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining whether a given function is continuous at each point. This requires analyzing the graph of the function to check for any discontinuities such as breaks, jumps, or holes. The graph is titled 'Graph of the Function' and has an x-axis labeled 'x' with ticks at -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and a y-axis labeled 'f(x)' with ticks at -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Key points on the graph include A at (-2, 1), B at (0, 0), and C at (2, -1). The task is to determine if the function is continuous at each of these points and throughout the graph. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with options 'Yes' or 'No'. The final answer must map to one of these options.",
