  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the limit of a function as x approaches -1. This requires analyzing a graph or plot of the function to observe its behavior near x = -1. The graph is titled 'Graph of f(x)' and has x-axis ticks at -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and y-axis ticks at -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A key point labeled 'A' is located at (x = -1, y = 2) on the graph. The task is to find the limit, which is a typical calculus problem involving limits. The image is necessary to understand the function's behavior as the specific function is not described in the text.",
