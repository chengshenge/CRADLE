  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing two colors, Sky Blue and Web Maroon, based on numerical values extracted from an image. Sky Blue has a value of 45, while Web Maroon has a value of 60. The task is to determine if Sky Blue is less than Web Maroon. The comparison is likely numerical, given the values provided. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format, with options 'yes' and 'no'. The final answer must be mapped to one of these options. The criteria for comparison are not explicitly stated, but the numerical values suggest a straightforward comparison.",
