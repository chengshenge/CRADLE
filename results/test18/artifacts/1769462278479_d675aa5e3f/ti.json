  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure where ABCD is a square with an inscribed circle centered at O. The task is to find the angle ∠AMK. The square and the circle are key elements, and the angle is likely related to these shapes. The problem requires understanding the geometric properties of the square and the inscribed circle. The position of points M and K is not specified, which adds ambiguity to the problem. The solution requires calculating the angle ∠AMK and providing the answer as a floating-point number with one decimal place.",
