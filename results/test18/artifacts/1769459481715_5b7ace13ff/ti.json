  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram where the task is to compare the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of a brown metal sedan with the number of things to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The user is asked to determine if the number of tiny gray bicycles is greater than the number of things to the left of the tiny green bicycle. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The counts of the objects are crucial to solving the problem, but they are unreadable from the image. This creates a challenge in determining the correct answer. The problem requires careful analysis of the diagram to count the objects accurately.",
