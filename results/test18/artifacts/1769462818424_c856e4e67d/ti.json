  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the ratio of 'Dissatisfied' to 'Satisfied' responses based on numerical data extracted from a text region. The task is to compute this ratio and express it as a floating-point number with one decimal place. The known values are the counts of 'Dissatisfied' and 'Satisfied' responses, which are 45 and 90, respectively. The problem requires performing a simple division operation to find the ratio. The final answer must be presented in a specific format as instructed. There are no multiple-choice options provided, so the answer must be given as a numerical value.",
