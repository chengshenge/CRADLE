  "problem_state_summary": "An administrator at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is tracking the average wait time from month to month. The task is to determine the rate of change in average wait time between August and September. The data required for this calculation is presented in a table that lists average wait times for different months. Specifically, the table shows that the average wait time in August is 20 minutes and in September is 25 minutes. The problem requires calculating the rate of change in minutes per month, which should be an integer. The final answer must be presented as an integer value.",
