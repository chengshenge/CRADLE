  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining whether the value associated with the color 'Black' is greater than the value associated with 'Deep Sky Blue'. This comparison is likely represented in a chart, as suggested by the problem context. The chart is titled 'Color Comparison Chart' and has an x-axis labeled 'Colors' with ticks for Black, Deep Sky Blue, Red, and Green. The y-axis is labeled 'Value' with ticks ranging from 0 to 50. Key points extracted from the chart indicate that Black has a value of 35, while Deep Sky Blue has a value of 25. The task is to compare these values to answer the question. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with options 'yes' and 'no'.",
