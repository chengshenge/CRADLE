  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with two intersecting chords, AB and CD, at point E. The measure of angle D is given as 35 degrees, and the measure of angle AEC is given as 105 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle C. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options for the measure of angle C. The solution requires understanding the geometric properties of intersecting chords in a circle and using the given angle measures to find the unknown angle. The diagram is crucial for visualizing the relationships between the angles and chords.",
