  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total semiconductor demand for the computing and wireless sectors in the year 2014. The data is organized in a table format, which includes headers for Year, Sector, and Demand. The table provides specific demand values for the computing and wireless sectors in 2014. The task requires summing these values to find the total demand. The known demand for computing in 2014 is 150, and for wireless, it is 200. The problem asks for the total of these two values, which must be presented as a floating-point number with one decimal place.",
