  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying which model has the highest accuracy score when the pretrain loss is exactly 1.80. A chart is provided that plots accuracy scores against pretrain loss values for different models. The models in question are ICL, SFT, SFT 1/8, RFT k=100, RFT k=25, RET k=6, and RFT U13B. The task is to find the model with the highest accuracy score at the specified pretrain loss value. The chart includes key points that indicate the accuracy scores for each model at a pretrain loss of 1.80. The solution requires reading these values from the chart and determining which model has the highest score.",
