  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a chart that displays average working hours by country over several years. The task is to determine how many countries have people working more than 35 hours. The chart includes a title 'Average Working Hours by Country', with the x-axis labeled 'Year' and the y-axis labeled 'Average Working Hours'. The y-axis has ticks at 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 hours. The legend indicates four countries: Country A, Country B, Country C, and Country D. Key data points show that in 2010, Country A had 36 hours, Country B had 34 hours, Country C had 37 hours, and Country D had 33 hours. The goal is to count the number of countries where the working hours exceed 35, based on the chart data.",
