  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining how many objects are left after subtracting specific categories of objects from a total. The categories to be subtracted are rubber balls and yellow shiny things. The total number of objects is given as 15. The task is to subtract the number of rubber balls and yellow shiny things from this total. The known quantities include 5 rubber balls and 3 yellow shiny things. The goal is to find the remaining number of objects after these subtractions. The problem requires basic arithmetic operations to solve.",
