  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves understanding the relationship between pelicans and fish populations. It asks what happens to the fish population if the number of pelicans increases. The relationship is described in text form, indicating that an increase in pelicans leads to a decrease in fish. The task is to determine the effect on the fish population based on this relationship. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The correct answer must be selected from these options.",
