  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a model with 4 dots that are divided into 2 equal groups. The task is to determine how many dots are in each group. The total number of dots is given as 4, and they are divided into 2 groups. The unknown variable is the number of dots per group. The relationship between the total dots, the number of groups, and the dots per group is expressed as total_dots = dots_per_group * number_of_groups. The solution requires simple arithmetic division to find the number of dots per group. The answer must be an integer, as specified by the problem constraints.",
