  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with a diameter AB and a chord CD. The angle ∠ADC is given as 26 degrees. The task is to find the degree of angle ∠CAB. The circle is centered at point O, and points A, B, C, and D are on the circle. The problem is a geometry question that requires understanding the properties of circles and angles. The known angle ∠ADC is an inscribed angle, and AB being the diameter implies certain geometric properties that can be used to find ∠CAB. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options, and the correct answer must be selected from these options.",
