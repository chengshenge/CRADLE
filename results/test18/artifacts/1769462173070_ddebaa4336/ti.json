  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the value of r at a specific angle theta in a polar coordinate system. The angle theta is given as 3*pi/2 radians. The task is to find the corresponding value of r on a polar plot. The chart is expected to have theta on the x-axis and r on the y-axis. The visual information suggests that at theta = 3*pi/2, the value of r is 2. The problem requires confirming this value from the chart. The final answer should be an integer value.",
