  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB, which has a length of 10 units. The task is to find the length of the segment CD. The problem is presented with a diagram that likely shows the triangle and the relevant points. The solution requires understanding the geometric properties of the triangle and the relationships between the points. The problem is multiple-choice, with four options provided for the length of CD.",
