  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals, John and Alice, whose ages are provided in an image. John's age is 25 years, and Alice's age is 30 years. The task is to calculate the difference between these two ages to find the age gap. The problem specifies that the age gap should be an integer. The ages are extracted from the image, and the calculation involves a simple subtraction. The final answer should be presented as an integer value.",
