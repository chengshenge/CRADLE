  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves understanding the impact of eliminating algae on various organisms within an aquatic ecosystem. Algae are primary producers and serve as a food source for several organisms. The task is to determine which organism would be most affected if algae were removed. The organisms in question include Tilapia, Common water flea, Great diving beetle, and Tadpole. Each of these organisms has a different relationship with algae, either directly or indirectly. The problem requires analyzing these relationships to identify the organism most dependent on algae.",
