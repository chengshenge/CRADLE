  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle is depicted in a diagram with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments AB and BC are marked as 5 cm and 3 cm, respectively. To find the perimeter, the dimensions of the rectangle must be identified from the diagram. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula 2 * (length + width). The task requires extracting these dimensions from the visual information provided in the diagram. The final answer should be an integer value representing the perimeter.",
