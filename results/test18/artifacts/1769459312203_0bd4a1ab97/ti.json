  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying and subtracting specific objects based on their descriptions from a given set. The objects to be subtracted are 'large rubber spheres' and 'big shiny cylinders'. The task is to determine how many objects remain after these specified objects are removed. The descriptions of the objects are provided as text labels, and the counts of these objects are given. The total number of objects subtracted is 5, which includes 3 large rubber spheres and 2 big shiny cylinders. The final goal is to compute the number of objects left after the subtraction. The problem requires an integer answer representing the remaining objects.",
