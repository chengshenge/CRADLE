  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a rhombus ABCD with given side and diagonal lengths. Points E and F are midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. The task is to find the length of segment EF. The known values are AB = 5 and AC = 6. The problem requires understanding the geometric properties of the rhombus and the relationship between its sides and diagonals. The length of EF is not directly marked on the diagram, and it must be computed using the given information. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the length of EF.",
