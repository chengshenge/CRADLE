  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the perimeter of a square. The square is depicted in a diagram with its vertices labeled as A, B, C, and D. The side length of the square is given as 5 cm, which is crucial for calculating the perimeter. The task requires using the known side length to compute the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a square. The final answer should be an integer value. The problem is straightforward and involves basic geometric understanding.",
