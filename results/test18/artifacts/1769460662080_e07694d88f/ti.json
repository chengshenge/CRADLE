  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining whether a given function is odd or even. The function is represented in a graph, which is attached as an image. The x-axis is labeled 'x' with ticks ranging from -3 to 3, and the y-axis is labeled 'f(x)' with the same tick range. The task is to analyze the symmetry of the function based on its graph. A function is even if f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain, and it is odd if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain. The problem provides two options: odd or even, and the correct answer must be selected from these options.",
