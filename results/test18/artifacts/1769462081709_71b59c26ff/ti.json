  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric configuration with points A, B, C, and D on a circle centered at O, and point E on the extended line of AD. The angle ∠ABC is given as 60 degrees. The task is to determine the measure of angle ∠CDE. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the value of ∠CDE. The diagram is crucial for understanding the spatial relationships and angles involved. The known information includes the angle ∠ABC and the positions of the points on the circle and line. The unknown is the measure of angle ∠CDE, which must be computed using the given geometric relationships.",
