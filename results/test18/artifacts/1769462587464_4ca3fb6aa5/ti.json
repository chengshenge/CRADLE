  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing the number of brown SUVs to the number of brown rubber school buses. The task is to determine if the number of brown SUVs is less than the number of brown rubber school buses. The known values extracted from the image indicate that there are 5 brown SUVs and 8 brown rubber school buses. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with two options: 'Yes' and 'No'. The solution requires comparing these two quantities to determine which is greater. The final answer must be mapped to one of the provided options.",
