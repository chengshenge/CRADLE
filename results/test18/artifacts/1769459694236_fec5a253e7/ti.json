  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining how many objects are preferred by more than 90 percent of people in at least one category. A chart titled 'Preferences of Objects by Percentage' is provided, with the x-axis labeled 'Objects' and the y-axis labeled 'Percentage'. The chart includes a legend with three categories. The task is to identify objects that have a preference percentage exceeding 90% in any of these categories. The visual data indicates that Object A, Object C, and Object E meet this criterion. The final answer should be an integer representing the count of such objects.",
