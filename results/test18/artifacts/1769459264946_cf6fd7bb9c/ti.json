  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two of its internal angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The angle bisectors OB and OC create a specific geometric configuration that must be used to determine the unknown angle. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four possible answers.",
