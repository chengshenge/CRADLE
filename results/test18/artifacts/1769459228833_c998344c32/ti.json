  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup has visible numeric markings that indicate different volume levels. The task is to identify the largest marking on the cup, which represents its total volume. The image attached to the problem shows these markings, and the largest visible marking is 500. The problem requires reading this number from the image to provide the total volume. The answer must be an integer value, as specified in the hint.",
