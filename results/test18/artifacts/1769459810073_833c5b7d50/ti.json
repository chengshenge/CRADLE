  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing sales data presented in a table format. The table contains rows representing different items and columns for sales figures from different stores. The task is to determine how many items sold less than 5 units in at least one store. This requires checking each item's sales data across all stores. The table headers include 'Item', 'Store A', 'Store B', and 'Store C'. The sales figures for each item in these stores are provided. The goal is to count the number of items that meet the condition of having sales less than 5 units in at least one store.",
