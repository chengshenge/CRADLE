  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric transformation where a sector of a circle with a central angle of 120 degrees and a radius of 6 cm is rolled into a conical shape without a bottom. The task is to determine the bottom perimeter of the resulting conical paper cap. The arc length of the sector, which is determined by the central angle and radius, becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the bottom perimeter, and the correct choice must be identified. The diagram likely illustrates the sector and its dimensions, which are crucial for solving the problem. The task requires understanding the relationship between the sector's arc length and the cone's base circumference.",
