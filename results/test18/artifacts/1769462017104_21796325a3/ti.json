  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a chart that displays two lines, Line A and Line B, representing data points over several years. The task is to determine which year shows the largest difference between the data points of these two lines. The chart is titled 'Annual Data Comparison' and includes an x-axis labeled 'Year' with ticks from 2015 to 2020, and a y-axis labeled 'Value' with ticks from 0 to 50. The legend identifies the two lines as Line A and Line B. The key point for the year 2020 indicates a difference of 15 between the two lines, which is the largest difference noted. The problem requires identifying this year based on the visual data comparison.",
