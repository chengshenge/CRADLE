  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure, specifically a triangle ABC with a point D inside it. The line CD bisects angle ACB, and BD is perpendicular to CD. It is given that angle A is equal to angle ABD. Additionally, angle DBC is provided as 54 degrees. The task is to determine the measure of angle A. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the value of angle A. The relationships between the angles and lines are crucial to solving the problem, and these are typically represented in a diagram.",
