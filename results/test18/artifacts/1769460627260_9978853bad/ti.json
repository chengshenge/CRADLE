  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a bar chart to determine how many bars have values smaller than 6. The chart displays bars labeled A to E, with values indicated on the y-axis ranging from 0 to 10. The task is to count the number of bars that meet the condition of having values less than 6. According to the visual data, bars A, B, and D have values of 5, 3, and 2 respectively, which are all less than 6. Bars C and E have values of 7 and 8, which do not meet the condition. The final goal is to provide the count of bars that satisfy the condition, which is an integer value.",
