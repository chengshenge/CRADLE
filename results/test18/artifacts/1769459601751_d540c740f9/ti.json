  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual inspection of an image containing various objects. The task is to count all objects and then subtract those that are red and those that are tiny matte balls. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The image contains a total of 20 objects, out of which 5 are red and 3 are tiny matte balls. The problem requires an integer answer representing the number of objects left after the specified subtractions. The exact definitions of 'tiny' and 'matte' are not provided, which may introduce some ambiguity in counting.",
