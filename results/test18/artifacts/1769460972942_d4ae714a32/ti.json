  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle 3 from a geometric diagram. The diagram likely contains multiple labeled angles, including angle 3, which is the focus of the question. The task is to identify the correct measure of angle 3 from the given options. The options provided are numerical values, indicating that the answer must be one of these values. The problem is a straightforward geometry question, requiring the interpretation of a diagram to find the measure of a specific angle. The image is necessary to fully understand the geometric context and to identify angle 3 accurately.",
