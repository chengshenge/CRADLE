  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying digits located on either end of a sign in the corner of an image. The task is to calculate the sum of these digits. The image contains a sign with digits '5' and '3' identified as being on either end. The problem requires a simple arithmetic operation to find the sum of these digits. The final answer should be an integer. The problem is presented in a textual format, and the digits have been extracted from the image for calculation.",
