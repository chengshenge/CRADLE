  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a table to determine if there is a shortage or surplus at a price of $790. The table contains data on supply and demand at various prices. The specific task is to compare the supply and demand values at the price of $790. A shortage occurs when demand exceeds supply, while a surplus occurs when supply exceeds demand. The table provides the necessary data to make this determination. The known price is $790, and the supply and demand at this price are both 1050. The problem asks to identify whether there is a shortage or surplus at this price point.",
