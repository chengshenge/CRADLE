  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two people whose ages are provided in an image. The ages are extracted from the text in the image, with person 1 being 25 years old and person 2 being 30 years old. The task is to compute the difference between these two ages to find the age gap. The problem requires basic arithmetic subtraction to find the difference. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years. The image text is the primary source of information for this problem.",
