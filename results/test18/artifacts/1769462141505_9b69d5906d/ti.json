  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a food web diagram where algae are a primary food source for certain species. The question asks about the ecological impact on various species if all the algae died due to pesticides. The species in question include crabs, limpets, dolphins, sea gulls, and star fish. The relationships in the food web are such that algae directly affect crabs and limpets, which in turn affect other species. The task is to determine how the death of algae will impact these species, considering the food web dependencies. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options regarding the potential outcomes for these species.",
