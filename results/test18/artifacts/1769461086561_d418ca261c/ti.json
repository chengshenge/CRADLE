  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual comparison of two groups of objects based on their attributes. Specifically, it asks whether the number of gray rubber objects located in front of a small yellow aeroplane is greater than the number of big cyan matte fighters. The task requires identifying and counting these objects in the image. The known constraints are that the gray rubber objects must be in front of the small yellow aeroplane, and the fighters must be big, cyan, and matte. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The image is crucial for determining the counts, but there are readability issues with the image, making it difficult to ascertain the exact numbers visually.",
