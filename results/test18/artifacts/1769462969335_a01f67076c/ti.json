  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves finding the sum of all values in a group labeled as the 'ruling group'. The task is to identify the values associated with this group and perform an arithmetic sum. The table provided contains multiple rows, each with a group label and a corresponding value. Specifically, the 'Ruling Group' has values of 10, 15, and 20. The goal is to sum these values to find the total. The answer must be an integer, as specified in the problem constraints. The problem does not provide any multiple-choice options, so the final answer should be presented as a single integer value.",
