  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a physical scenario where a cumin canister of mass 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with an initial speed of 0.50 m/s. The canister then collides with a spring, compressing it. The spring has a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to determine the distance by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped. This involves understanding the conversion of kinetic energy of the canister into the potential energy stored in the spring. The problem is likely depicted in a diagram, which should show the canister, the spring, and possibly the displacement. However, the diagram's labels or numbers are unreadable, which could hinder the extraction of specific visual information.",
