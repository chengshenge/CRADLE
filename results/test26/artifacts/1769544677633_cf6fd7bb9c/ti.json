  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known elements include angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The solution requires using the properties of angle bisectors and the triangle angle sum property to determine the measure of angle BOC.",
