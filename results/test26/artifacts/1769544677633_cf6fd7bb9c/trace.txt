[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in t ... he known elements include angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The solution requires using the properties of angle bisectors and the triangle angle sum property to determine the measure of angle BOC.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the triangle angle sum property to find the sum of angles B and C
  2. Apply the properties of angle bisectors to find the measure of angle BOC
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure the correct application of the triangle angle sum property
  • Verify the properties of angle bisectors are correctly applied

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: To compute the numeric expression for the sum of angles B and C using the triangle angle sum property.
  • format_final: To format the final answer in the required format.
- new_skill_specs:
  • find_angle_boc (angle_a, options)->str

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (python) Calculate the sum of angles B and C using the triangle angle sum property.
     code: sum_BC = calc_numeric('180 - 110')
  2. (python) Determine the measure of angle BOC using the properties of angle bisectors.
     code: angle_BOC = sum_BC / 2
  3. (reason) Map the calculated angle BOC to the closest option.
     note: The calculated angle BOC is 70°, which corresponds to option (A) 135°.
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer as required.
     text: Answer: 135°
