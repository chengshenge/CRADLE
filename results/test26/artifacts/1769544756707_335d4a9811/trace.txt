[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests that the image likely contains a geometric diagram with labeled angles.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task requires identifying the measure of a specific angle from a diagram, which involves understanding geometric properties and possibly using angle sum properties.

- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['m∠H']
- readability_issues:
  • The measure of angle H is unreadable.
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves finding the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram contains labels for points A through H, but the measure of angle H is not readable from the image.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The diagram contains labels for points A through H.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact geometric configuration and labels in the diagram are unknown without OCR.
  • The measure of angle H is unreadable.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled points, including point H, and possibly other geometric figures such as triangles. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is ... perties if triangles are involved. The measure of angle H is related to other angles or geometric properties in the diagram, but these relationships are not explicitly provided. The problem is a geometry question that requires visual inspection of the diagram.
- required_operations:
  1. Inspect the diagram to identify angle H
  2. Determine the measure of angle H using geometric properties
  3. Map the measure to one of the provided options
- blockers: ['m∠H']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • angle markers

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and constraints
     note: The measure of angle H is unreadable from the diagram.
  2. (reason) Use geometric properties to deduce m∠H
     note: Assume angle sum properties or other geometric relations to deduce m∠H.
  3. (reason) Select the closest option for m∠H
     note: Choose the option that best fits the deduced measure of angle H.
  4. (normalize) Output the final answer
