  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a diagram to count the remaining objects after removing specific types based on their properties. The task is to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The image is supposed to contain various objects with different properties such as size, material, and shape. However, the image does not clearly show large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders, making it difficult to perform the required subtractions. The problem requires an integer answer representing the number of objects left after the specified subtractions. The ambiguity in the image and the lack of clarity in object identification are significant challenges in solving this problem.",
