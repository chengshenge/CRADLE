The executor blocks `import`. Use the provided skills (calc_numeric, sympy_solve, format_final) and the built-in `math` module only.\n- Prefer calling sympy_solve(\"...\", \"d\") rather than trying to import sympy.\n- Do not round intermediate results to 1 decimal place. Keep at least 3 significant digits (or 3+ decimals) before format_final.\n- Do NOT use python-style string formatting in JSON fields (e.g., \"...\".format(x)).
