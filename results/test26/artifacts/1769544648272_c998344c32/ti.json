  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup, which is likely indicated by markings or labels on the cup itself. The task is to find this total volume, which is expected to be marked on the diagram of the measuring cup. The known information extracted from the image is a maximum marking of 500, but the unit is not specified. The question asks for the total volume in grams, which is unusual for volume measurements, suggesting a need to interpret the markings correctly. The image is unreadable, and no additional markings or labels could be extracted, making it difficult to confirm the total volume. The task is straightforward but requires reading a specific value from the image, which is currently a challenge due to the unreadability of the image.",
