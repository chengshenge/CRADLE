[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests a geometric diagram is present in the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to determine the measure of a specific angle, which is a straightforward geometry problem.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['m∠H']
- readability_issues:
  • The diagram is present but specific angle measures or relationships are not readable.
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves finding the measure of angle H, which is part of a geometric diagram. The options for the measure of angle H are provided, but the diagram does not have readable angle measures or relationships.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The image likely contains a geometric diagram with angle H.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact geometric configuration and any given angle measures or relationships are not specified in the text.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H, which is part of a geometric diagram. The task is to find the measure of this angle using the information provided in the diagram. However, the specific geometric configuration and any given angle measur ... estion with four options for the measure of angle H. The diagram is expected to contain relevant geometric information, but the exact details are not readable. The task is straightforward but requires interpreting the diagram to find the correct angle measure.
- required_operations:
  1. Interpret the geometric diagram
  2. Identify angle H
  3. Determine the measure of angle H
  4. Map the measure to one of the given options
- blockers: ['m∠H']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • angle markers

[SC] Skill Curation
- new_skill_specs:
  • interpret_geometric_diagram (image_hash:str)->dict
  • map_angle_to_option (angle_measure:int, options:List[dict])->str

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and limitations
     note: The diagram is unreadable, and m∠H is unresolved.
  2. (reason) Select the most reasonable option
     note: Without readable data, choose the most likely option based on typical angle measures.
  3. (normalize) Choose the most common angle measure
     text: Answer: 107

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify blockers and limitations
  - reason: Select the most reasonable option
  - normalize: Answer: 107

[SR] Self-Reflection / Answer Polishing
- confidence: 0.0

[FINAL]
- final_answer: Answer: 107
