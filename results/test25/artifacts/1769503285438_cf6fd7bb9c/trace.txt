[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: no
- asks: ['∠BOC']
- unknown: ['∠BOC']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves geometry, specifically the angles and angle bisectors in triangle △ABC. A diagram would likely illustrate these elements.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to calculate the angle ∠BOC using the given angle ∠A and the properties of angle bisectors in a triangle.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['∠BOC']
- readability_issues:
  • unreadable
- gti_reasoning:
  • The diagram is expected to show triangle △ABC with angle bisectors OB and OC. The known angle ∠A is 110°, and the task is to find ∠BOC. The diagram labels and marked relations are extracted, but the image is unreadable for further details.

- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • OB and OC are angle bisectors
  • Diagram labels: A, B, C, O
- ambiguity:
  • The problem does not specify the exact configuration of triangle △ABC, but it is assumed to be a standard triangle with angle bisectors.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. The given information includes angle ∠A, which measures 110°. The task is to determine the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is set in a geometric context, wher ... problem is presented with multiple-choice options, and the correct angle must be selected from these options. A diagram is expected to illustrate the triangle and its angle bisectors, but the image is unreadable, which poses a challenge in visual verification.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the angle sum property of triangles to find ∠B and ∠C
  2. Apply the properties of angle bisectors to find ∠BOC
- blockers: ['∠BOC']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • angle markers

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and known values
     note: The problem involves finding ∠BOC using given ∠A = 110° and angle bisectors.
  2. (python) Calculate ∠B and ∠C using angle sum property
     code: angle_B_plus_C = 180 - 110
  3. (python) Calculate ∠BOC using properties of angle bisectors
     code: angle_BOC = 0.5 * angle_B_plus_C
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: 135°
