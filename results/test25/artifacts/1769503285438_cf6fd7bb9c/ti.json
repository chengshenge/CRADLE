  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. The given information includes angle ∠A, which measures 110°. The task is to determine the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is set in a geometric context, where understanding the properties of angle bisectors is crucial. The sum of the angles in triangle △ABC is constrained to 180°. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options, and the correct angle must be selected from these options. A diagram is expected to illustrate the triangle and its angle bisectors, but the image is unreadable, which poses a challenge in visual verification.",
