[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a physical scenario where a cumin canister of mass 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with an initial speed of 0.50 m/s. It then collides with and compresses a spring with a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to d ... the spring. The problem requires calculating this compression distance using the principles of energy conservation. The diagram associated with the problem likely illustrates the canister, spring, and the distance 'd', but some labels are partially unreadable.
