  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known relation is that OB and OC are angle bisectors, and the constraint is that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options provided.",
