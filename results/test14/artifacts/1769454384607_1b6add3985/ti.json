  "problem_state_summary": "A cumin canister with a mass of 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter at a speed of 0.50 m/s. It collides with a spring that has a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to determine the distance by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped. The problem involves the conversion of the canister's kinetic energy into the potential energy of the spring. The setup is likely depicted in a diagram showing the spring, canister, and the distance of compression. The solution requires calculating the compression distance using the principles of energy conservation.",
