  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence of objects. The task is to determine which object follows a given sequence, likely involving pattern recognition or sequence analysis. The sequence is represented visually in a diagram, and the options for the next object are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. The specific pattern or rule governing the sequence is not provided in the text and must be inferred from the image. The problem requires analyzing the visual sequence to predict the next object based on the identified pattern. The final answer must be mapped to one of the provided option labels.",
