  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the number of objects remaining after subtracting specific types of objects from a total. Initially, there are 50 objects in total. Among these, 15 are large rubber spheres and 10 are big shiny cylinders. The task is to subtract the number of large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The goal is to find out how many objects are left after these subtractions. The problem requires basic arithmetic operations to compute the remaining number of objects. The final answer should be an integer representing the count of remaining objects.",
