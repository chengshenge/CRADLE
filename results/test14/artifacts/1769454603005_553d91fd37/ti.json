  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric diagram with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4.0 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options for the length of AC. The exact positions of points A, B, C, and D are not specified in the text, which may require careful examination of the diagram. The solution involves understanding the geometric relationship that D, being the midpoint, divides AC into two equal parts.",
