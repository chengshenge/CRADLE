  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle at vertex A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The sum of angles in a triangle is a key constraint. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options for the measure of angle BOC.",
