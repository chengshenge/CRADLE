  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram where the task is to compare two quantities: the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of a brown metal sedan and the number of things to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The question asks whether the former is greater than the latter. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The task requires visual inspection of the diagram to count the relevant objects. The known elements include the presence of a brown metal sedan, tiny gray bicycles, and a tiny green bicycle. The problem is essentially a logic-based comparison task that relies on spatial arrangement within the diagram.",
