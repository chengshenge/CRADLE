  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup is likely depicted in an attached image as a diagram with volume markings. The task is to find the total volume, which is likely indicated by these markings. The unit for the volume is given as grams (g), which is unusual for volume, suggesting a need to interpret the image markings carefully. The image is unreadable, making it difficult to extract the necessary information. The problem requires identifying the total volume from the image, which involves reading volume markings on the diagram of the measuring cup.",
