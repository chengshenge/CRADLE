  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled angles, including angle H, but the measure of angle H is unreadable. The task is to identify the correct measure of angle H from the given multiple-choice options. The problem is a straightforward geometry question, requiring interpretation of the diagram to find the unknown angle. The options provided are 97, 102, 107, and 122 degrees. The solution must map the correct measure to one of these options. The diagram's configuration and relationships between angles are not specified in the text, adding some ambiguity to the task.",
