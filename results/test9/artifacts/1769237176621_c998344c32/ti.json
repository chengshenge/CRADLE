  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup is depicted in a diagram with volume markings. The markings on the cup are labeled as 100g, 200g, 300g, 400g, and 500g. The task is to interpret these markings to find the total volume of the cup. The unit of measurement is specified as grams, which is unusual for volume, suggesting a possible need to interpret the markings in terms of weight. The final answer should be an integer value representing the total volume.",
