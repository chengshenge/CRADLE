  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the value of ∠BOC. The known information includes the measure of angle ∠A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The problem requires understanding the geometric properties of angle bisectors in a triangle to determine the unknown angle ∠BOC.",
