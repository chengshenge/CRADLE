QUESTION: Question: Which object comes next? Choices: (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) E Hint: Please answer the question and provide t ... nd your response with a single line in the form "Answer: <value>". For example: Answer: 145° or Answer: tokyo. Solution:

[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: no
- asks: ['next object in sequence']
- unknown: ['next object in sequence']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence, which suggests a visual pattern or sequence in the image. Therefore, the most relevant region is the diagram.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to identify the next object in a sequence, which is a pattern recognition task based on visual information.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['next object in sequence']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves identifying the next object in a sequence, which is a pattern recognition task based on visual information. The options A to E are extracted as they represent the possible choices for the next object in the sequence.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The image contains a sequence of objects and a set of choices labeled A to E.
- ambiguity:
  • The pattern or rule governing the sequence is not explicitly stated and must be inferred from the image.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence from a set of choices labeled A to E. This is a pattern recognition task based on visual information provided in a diagram. The sequence pattern is not explicitly stated, so it must be inferred fro ... ct that logically follows the given sequence. The choices are presented as options A, B, C, D, and E. The problem is a logic-based question that relies on visual pattern recognition. The final answer must be provided as the exact content of the correct choice.
- required_operations:
  1. analyze diagram
  2. identify sequence pattern
  3. determine next object
  4. map to choice
- blockers: ['next object in sequence']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • pattern inference from visual data

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and proceed with grounded information.
     note: The blocker is identifying the next object in the sequence. Proceed with visual pattern recognition.
  2. (reason) Analyze the diagram to identify the sequence pattern.
     note: The task is to recognize the pattern in the sequence of objects and determine the next object.
  3. (reason) Determine the next object in the sequence.
     note: Based on the visual pattern, identify which object logically follows in the sequence.
  4. (normalize) Map the identified object to the correct choice.

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify blockers and proceed with grounded information.
  - reason: Analyze the diagram to identify the sequence pattern.
  - reason: Determine the next object in the sequence.
