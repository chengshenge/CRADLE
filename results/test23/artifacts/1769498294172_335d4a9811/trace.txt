[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests that the image likely contains a geometric diagram with labeled angles.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to identify the measure of a specific angle from a diagram, which is a straightforward geometry problem.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['m∠H']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The diagram contains labeled points and angles, with angle H specifically marked with a value. The options provided in the problem are extracted as potential answers for the measure of angle H.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The diagram contains labeled points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
  • Angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact relationships or additional angles in the diagram are not specified in the prompt.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled points and angles, with angle H being a focal point. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is related to other angles or ge ... e diagram. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the measure of angle H. The visual information indicates that angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees. The problem requires mapping the correct measure of angle H to one of the provided options.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify angle H in the diagram
  2. Verify the marked value of angle H
  3. Map the value to the correct option
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure label-to-segment mapping is correct
  • Verify angle markers for accuracy

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify the measure of angle H from the diagram.
     note: The diagram indicates that angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees.
  2. (reason) Map the identified measure to the correct option.
     note: The value 102 matches option B.
  3. (normalize) Format the final answer as required.
