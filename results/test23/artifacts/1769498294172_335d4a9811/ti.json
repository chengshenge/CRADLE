  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled points and angles, with angle H being a focal point. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is related to other angles or geometric properties in the diagram. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the measure of angle H. The visual information indicates that angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees. The problem requires mapping the correct measure of angle H to one of the provided options.",
