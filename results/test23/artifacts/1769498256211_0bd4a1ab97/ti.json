  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves counting the number of objects remaining after removing specific types of objects. The objects are described by their size and material or finish, specifically large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders. The task requires identifying these objects from a list and subtracting them from the total number of objects. The exact number of each type of object is not specified in the prompt and must be determined from the image. The image is not available for analysis, so the counts of the specified objects cannot be determined. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
