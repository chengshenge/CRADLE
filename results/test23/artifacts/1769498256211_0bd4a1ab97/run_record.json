The executor blocks `import`. Use the provided skills (calc_numeric, sympy_solve, format_final) and the built-in `math` module only.\n- Prefer calling sympy_solve(\"...\", \"d\") rather than trying to import sympy.\n- Do not round intermediate results to 1 decimal place. Keep at least 3 significant digits (or 3+ decimals) before format_final.\n- Do NOT use python-style string formatting in JSON fields (e.g., \"...\".format(x)).

The objects are described by their size and material or finish, specifically large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders. The task requires identifying the ... of object is not specified in the prompt and must be determined from the image. The image is not available for analysis, so the counts of the specified objects cannot be determined. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
