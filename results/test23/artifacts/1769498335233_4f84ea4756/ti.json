  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure with points A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4.0 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the length of AC. The solution requires understanding the relationship between the given segments and the midpoint property. The diagram is essential for visualizing the relationships between the points and segments.",
