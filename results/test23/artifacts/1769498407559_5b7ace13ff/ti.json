  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a comparison between two quantities related to the positions of bicycles and other objects in a diagram. Specifically, it asks whether the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of a brown metal sedan is greater than the number of things to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The task requires analyzing a diagram to count these objects and compare their numbers. However, the image needed to verify these counts is not available, making it impossible to determine the exact numbers. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The solution requires mapping the final answer to one of these options.",
