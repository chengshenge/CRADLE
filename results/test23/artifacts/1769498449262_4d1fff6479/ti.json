  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure known as a 'Pythagorean tree', which consists of squares and right triangles. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled as C, given the areas of two smaller squares, A and B. The areas of squares A and B are provided as 5 and 3 square units, respectively. The relationship between these squares and the triangles is governed by the Pythagorean theorem, which suggests a mathematical relationship between their areas. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the area of square C. The diagram is expected to show the configuration of the Pythagorean tree, including labels for squares A, B, and C. The exact configuration must be inferred from the diagram to solve the problem.",
