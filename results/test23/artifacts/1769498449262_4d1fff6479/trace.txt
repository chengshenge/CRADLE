- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['Area of square C']
- unknown: ['Area of square C']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves a geometric figure described as a '勾股树' (Pythagorean tree), which includes squares and right triangles. The image likely contains the geometric configuration needed to understand the relationships between these shapes.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to determine the area of square C using the given areas of squares A and B and the geometric properties of the Pythagorean tree.

- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['Area of square C']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The diagram likely contains labels for squares A, B, and C, which are part of the Pythagorean tree. The task is to identify these labels and any other relevant geometric information that can help determine the area of square C.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The image likely shows a Pythagorean tree with squares and right triangles.
  • Diagram labels: A, B, C
- ambiguity:
  • The exact configuration of the Pythagorean tree is not described in the text and must be inferred from the image.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a geometric figure known as a 'Pythagorean tree', which consists of squares and right triangles. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled as C, given the areas of two smaller squares, A and B. The areas of squares A ... resented with multiple-choice options for the area of square C. The diagram is expected to show the configuration of the Pythagorean tree, including labels for squares A, B, and C. The exact configuration must be inferred from the diagram to solve the problem.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify the configuration of the Pythagorean tree in the diagram
  2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to relate the areas of squares A, B, and C
  3. Calculate the area of square C
  4. Map the calculated area to one of the multiple-choice options
- blockers: ['Area of square C']
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure correct label-to-segment mapping in the diagram
  • Verify that all quadrilaterals are squares and all triangles are right triangles
  • Check for any missing or unclear labels in the diagram

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: Calculate the area of square C using the Pythagorean theorem.
  • format_final: Format the final answer to match the multiple-choice options.

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and known values
     note: The problem involves a Pythagorean tree with squares A, B, and C. Areas of A and B are given.
  2. (python) Apply Pythagorean theorem to find area of square C
     code: area_A = 5; area_B = 3; area_C = area_A + area_B
  3. (reason) Map calculated area to multiple-choice options
     note: Calculated area of square C is 8, which matches option D.
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: 8
