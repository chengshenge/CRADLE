  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying the next object in a sequence of objects, which is presented as a diagram. The sequence is not explicitly described, so the pattern must be inferred from the visual elements. The task is to determine which object follows the given sequence from the provided options. The diagram contains labels corresponding to the options: A, B, C, D, and E. The problem is a typical logic problem requiring pattern recognition. The solution must be provided as one of the option labels.",
