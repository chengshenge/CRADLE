  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric diagram with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4.0 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. It is stated that D is the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC using the provided information. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options for the length of AC. The solution requires understanding the concept of a midpoint and applying it to find the unknown length. The diagram is crucial for visualizing the relationships between the points and segments.",
