  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the value of ∠BOC. The known information includes the measure of angle ∠A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The sum of angles in a triangle is a key constraint that must be considered. The problem requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and their impact on the angles within the triangle.",
