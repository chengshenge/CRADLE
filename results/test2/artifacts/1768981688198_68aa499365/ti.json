  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes labeled points A through H and various angles, including m∠H. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is marked in the diagram as 102 degrees. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options. The correct measure of angle H is directly provided in the diagram, simplifying the task. The problem requires identifying the correct option that matches the marked angle value.",
