Since AB is the hypotenuse and it bisects \u2220CAG, we know \u2220BAG = \u2220CAG/2 = 30\u00b0.\n3. Since lines DE and FG are parallel, \u2220CAG = \u2220ACH (alternate interior angles).\n4.

OD bisects \u2220AOE.\n\nSince OD bisects \u2220AOE, we have:\n\n\u2220AOD = \u2220DOE.\n\nThe angles around point O sum up to 360\u00b0. Therefore, we have:\n\n\u2220AOB + \u2220BOC + \u2220COE + \u2220EOA = 360\u00b0.\n\nSince \u2220AOB and \u2220COE are on the same straight line, they are supplementary:\n\n\u2220AOB + \u2220BOC = 180\u00b0.\n\nGiven \u2220BOC = 50\u00b0, we find:\n\n\u2220AOB = 180\u00b0 - 50\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\n\nNow, \u2220AOE = \u2220AOD + \u2220DOE = 2\u2220AOD.\n\nSince \u2220AOB + \u2220BOC + \u2220COE + \u2220EOA = 360\u00b0, and \u2220AOB = 130\u00b0, \u2220BOC = 50\u00b0, we have:\n\n130\u00b0 + 50\u00b0 + \u2220COE + \u2220EOA = 360\u00b0.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\u2220COE + \u2220EOA = 180\u00b0.\n\nSince \u2220EOA = 2\u2220AOD, we have:\n\n\u2220COE + 2\u2220AOD = 180\u00b0.\n\nNow, \u2220EOB = \u2220COE.\n\nSince \u2220BOC = 50\u00b0, \u2220COE = 180\u00b0 - 50\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, \u2220EOB = 130\u00b0 - \u2220AOD.\n\nSince \u2220AOD = \u2220DOE and \u2220AOE = 2\u2220AOD, we have:\n\n\u2220AOD = (180\u00b0 - 130\u00b0) / 2 = 25\u00b0.\n\nThus, \u2220EOB = 130\u00b0 - 25\u00b0 = 105\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n\u2220AOD = \u2220DOE = 25\u00b0.\n\n\u2220EOB = \u2220BOC = 50\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: 50\u00b0",

Given \u2220DCF = 20\u00b0, we can find \u2220CDF:\n   \\[\n   \\angle CDF = 90\u00b0 - \\angle DCF = 90\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 = 70\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n3.

Since \u2220O is given as 110\u00b0, and it subtends the same arc as \u2220C, we need to consider the external angle theorem or the properties of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the angle subtended by the same arc on the opposite side of the circle is supplementary to the angle at the center:\n\n\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - \u2220O\n\n\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0\n\n\u2220C = 70\u00b0\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the choices, so let's consider the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:\n\n\u2220A + \u2220C = 180\u00b0\n\nIf \u2220O is an external angle and \u2220C is an internal angle, then:\n\n\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - \u2220O\n\n\u2220C = 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0\n\n\u2220C = 70\u00b0\n\nIt seems there might be a mistake in the problem setup or the choices. Based on the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the correct calculation should lead to \u2220C = 70\u00b0, but this is not among the given options. \n\nLet's assume there might be an error in the interpretation or the given choices. Based on the typical properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the correct angle should be:\n\nAnswer: 70\u00b0",

(The present global mean temperature is $290 \\mathrm{~K}$, and the equilibrium vapour pressure of water at that temperature is 0.0189 bar.)\nHint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nSolution:",

Therefore, the line segment MN is parallel to AB and half its length.\n\nGiven that MN = 20m, we can deduce that:\n\n\\[ AB = 2 \\times MN = 2 \\times 20m = 40m. \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between points A and B is 40 meters.\n\nAnswer: 40m.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of angles in a triangle and the fact that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180\u00b0.\n\n1. The angles on the straight line are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the 60\u00b0 angle. Therefore, \\(a + b + 60\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\). This means \\(a + b = 120\u00b0\\).\n\n2. Similarly, the angles on the straight line are \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and the 70\u00b0 angle. Therefore, \\(c + d + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\). This means \\(c + d = 110\u00b0\\).\n\n3. In the triangle, the sum of the angles is 180\u00b0. Therefore, \\(b + c + d = 180\u00b0\\).\n\n4. We know \\(c + d = 110\u00b0\\), so substituting this into the triangle equation gives \\(b + 110\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\). Therefore, \\(b = 70\u00b0\\).\n\n5. Substituting \\(b = 70\u00b0\\) into the equation \\(a + b = 120\u00b0\\) gives \\(a + 70\u00b0 = 120\u00b0\\). Therefore, \\(a = 50\u00b0\\).\n\n6. We already know \\(c + d = 110\u00b0\\). Since \\(b = 70\u00b0\\), and \\(b + c + d = 180\u00b0\\), we can find \\(c\\) by substituting \\(d = 110\u00b0 - c\\) into the equation \\(b + c + d = 180\u00b0\\):\n\n   \\[\n   70\u00b0 + c + (110\u00b0 - c) = 180\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying gives:\n\n   \\[\n   70\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n   \\]\n\n   This confirms the equation is correct, and we can find \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) individually if needed, but we already know \\(c + d = 110\u00b0\\).\n\n7. The remaining angle \\(e\\) is on the straight line with the 70\u00b0 angle, so \\(e + 70\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\\). Therefore, \\(e = 110\u00b0\\).\n\nComparing all the angles, we have:\n- \\(a = 50\u00b0\\)\n- \\(b = 70\u00b0\\)\n- \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are parts of 110\u00b0 (but individually less than ",

Thus, the rate of salt entering is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rate in} = r \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{r}{4} \\text{ lb/min}\n  \\]\n\n- **Rate of salt leaving the tank:** The concentration of salt in the tank is \\( \\frac{Q(t)}{100} \\) lb/gal, and the water leaves at a rate of \\( r \\) gal/min. Thus, the rate of salt leaving is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rate out} = r \\times \\frac{Q(t)}{100} = \\frac{rQ(t)}{100} \\text{ lb/min}\n  \\]\n\nThe differential equation is:\n\\[\n\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\text{Rate in} - \\text{Rate out} = \\frac{r}{4} - \\frac{rQ(t)}{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the differential equation\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{r}{4} - \\frac{rQ}{100}\n\\]\n\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation.

We are given that \\( m \\angle WXJ = 130^\\circ \\) and \\( m \\angle WZG = 20^\\circ \\).\n\n2. Since \\( \\angle WXJ \\) and \\( \\angle WZG \\) are on a straight line, we can find \\( \\angle XJZ \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   m \\angle XJZ = 180^\\circ - m \\angle WXJ = 180^\\circ - 130^\\circ = 50^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. We are also given that \\( \\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \\frac{HJ}{YJ} \\). This implies that triangles \\( \\triangle IJX \\) and \\( \\triangle HJY \\) are similar by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) similarity criterion.\n\n4. Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, \\( \\angle IJX = \\angle HJY \\).\n\n5. We know \\( m \\angle WZG = 20^\\circ \\), which means \\( m \\angle YIZ = 20^\\circ \\) because \\( \\angle WZG \\) and \\( \\angle YIZ \\) are vertical angles.\n\n6. Now, we need to find \\( m \\angle YIZ \\). Since \\( \\angle IJX = \\angle HJY \\) and \\( \\angle XJZ = 50^\\circ \\), we can find \\( m \\angle YIZ \\) by using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle \\( \\triangle YIZ \\) is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\n7. Therefore, \\( m \\angle YIZ = 180^\\circ - m \\angle XJZ - m \\angle WZG = 180^\\circ - 50^\\circ - 20^\\circ = 110^\\circ \\).\n\nAnswer: 110",

This is a classic problem of minimizing the perimeter of a triangle formed by a point on two sides of a right angle.\n\nThe key to solving this is to use the reflection method. Reflect point \\( A \\) across line \\( BC \\) to get point \\( A' \\). The shortest path from \\( A \\) to line \\( BC \\) and then to line \\( CD \\) is a straight line from \\( A' \\) to \\( D \\).\n\nTherefore, the line \\( A'D \\) will intersect \\( BC \\) at \\( M \\) and \\( CD \\) at \\( N \\). This ensures that the path \\( AMN \\) is the shortest.\n\nSince \\( \\angle BAD = 120^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle B = \\angle D = 90^\\circ \\), the quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) is a kite with \\( \\angle ABC = \\angle ADC = 90^\\circ \\).\n\nThe sum of the angles \\( \\angle AMN + \\angle ANM \\) in triangle \\( AMN \\) is given by the exterior angle theorem. Since \\( \\angle A = 120^\\circ \\), the sum of the other two angles in \\( \\triangle AMN \\) is \\( 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the degree of \\( \\angle AMN + \\angle ANM \\) is \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\nAnswer: 120\u00b0",

The ratio of similarity is given by the ratio of the segments on the sides of the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{EF}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AB} = \\frac{AF}{AC}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(BE + CF = 8\\), and knowing that \\(BE\\) and \\(CF\\) are segments on \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) respectively, we can use the properties of the incenter and parallel lines to find the length of \\(EF\\).\n\nSince \\(EF \\parallel BC\\), the length of \\(EF\\) is proportional to the sum of \\(BE\\) and \\(CF\\). The ratio of the areas of \\(\\triangle AEF\\) and \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{EF}{BC}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{AE}{AB}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{AF}{AC}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(BE + CF = 8\\), and knowing that \\(EF\\) is parallel to \\(BC\\) and divides the triangle proportionally, we can directly relate the length of \\(EF\\) to the given sum:\n\n\\[\nEF = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (BE + CF) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of \\(EF\\) is 4.\n\nAnswer: 4",

Since AB is the diameter, \u2220ABC is a right angle (90\u00b0) because it subtends a semicircle.\n\n2. **Finding \u2220ACB:**\n   - Since \u2220AOC is 80\u00b0, \u2220ACB is half of \u2220AOC because the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc. Therefore, \u2220ACB = 40\u00b0.\n\n3. **Using the Tangent-Secant Theorem:**\n   - The tangent-secant theorem states that the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Therefore, \u2220ADB = \u2220ACB.\n\nThus, \u2220ADB = 40\u00b0.\n\nAnswer: 40\u00b0",

Since \\( DA = DE \\), \\( \\triangle ADE \\) is isosceles, so \\( \\angle DEA = \\angle DAE \\).\n\n4. In \\( \\triangle ABD \\), the angles sum up to \\( 180^\\circ \\):\n   \\[\n   \\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\angle DAB - \\angle ADB = 180^\\circ - 20^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5.

The central angle is twice the inscribed angle:\n\n\u2220BOC = 2 * \u2220C\n\u2220BOC = 2 * 20\u00b0\n\u2220BOC = 40\u00b0\n\nAnswer: 40\u00b0",

Therefore, \u2220ACG + \u2220CGA = 90\u00b0, which means \u2220CGA = 90\u00b0 - 32\u00b0 = 58\u00b0.\n\nIn triangle ACG, we have:\n\u2220ACG = 32\u00b0\n\u2220CGA = 58\u00b0\n\nNow, consider triangle BFC. Since F is the intersection of the angle bisectors CD and BE, F is the incenter of triangle ABC. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle meet, and it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.\n\nSince \u2220ACG = 32\u00b0, and CG is perpendicular to AB, \u2220BFC is supplementary to \u2220ACG.
