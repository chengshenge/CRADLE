    "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

MODULE3's answer `0.018 m` is a float and includes a unit, which is appropriate for the context of the problem. MODULE2's answer `0.0` is also a float but lacks a unit, which is less informative.\n\n4. **Execution/Error Flags**: \n   - Both MODULE2 and MODULE3 outputs do not indicate any errors or execution issues.\n\nGiven these considerations, MODULE3's answer of `0.018 m` is more reasonable.
