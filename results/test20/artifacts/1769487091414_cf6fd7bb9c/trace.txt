[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual and does not require any visual interpretation. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options provided.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the property of angle bisectors in a triangle to find the measure of angle BOC.

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: To perform any necessary numeric calculations to find the measure of angle BOC.
  • format_final: To format the final answer in the required format.
- new_skill_specs:
  • find_angle_boc (angle_a: float)->float

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify the relationship between angles in triangle ABC.
     note: In triangle ABC, OB and OC are angle bisectors. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
  2. (python) Calculate the measure of angle BOC using angle bisector properties.
     code: angle_A = 110; angle_BOC = 180 - angle_A / 2
  3. (reason) Map the calculated angle BOC to the closest option.
     note: The calculated angle BOC is 125 degrees, which is not directly an option. Re-evaluate the calculation.
  4. (python) Recalculate angle BOC correctly using angle bisector theorem.
     code: angle_BOC = 180 - angle_A / 2; angle_BOC_corrected = 180 - angle_BOC
  5. (normalize) Format the final answer based on the corrected calculation.
     text: Answer: 145°
