  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual and does not require any visual interpretation. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options provided.",
