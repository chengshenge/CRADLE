  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves counting objects and subtracting specific types based on their descriptions. The task is to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects are left after these subtractions. The descriptions of the objects are provided in text form, and the image does not contain any large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders. Therefore, the subtraction involves removing zero objects of each type. The final task is to compute the remaining number of objects, which requires an integer answer.",
