QUESTION: Question: Subtract all large rubber spheres. Subtract all big shiny cylinders. How many objects are left? Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Solution:

[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: text
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['number of objects left']
- unknown: ['number of objects left']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem requires identifying and counting specific objects based on their descriptions, which are likely labeled or described in text within the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task involves identifying and counting objects based on their descriptions, then performing subtraction to find the remaining count.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: text
- extracted_text_lines: 2
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task requires identifying specific objects based on their descriptions, which are provided in text form within the image. The text 'large rubber spheres' and 'big shiny cylinders' are crucial for identifying which objects to count and subtract.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: text
- visual_facts:
  • Descriptions of objects such as 'large rubber spheres' and 'big shiny cylinders' are needed to identify which objects to subtract.
  • No large rubber spheres visible in the image.
  • No big shiny cylinders visible in the image.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact number of each type of object is not provided in the prompt and must be determined from the image.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves counting objects and subtracting specific types based on their descriptions. The task is to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects are left afte ... n text form, and the image does not contain any large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders. Therefore, the subtraction involves removing zero objects of each type. The final task is to compute the remaining number of objects, which requires an integer answer.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify and count all objects.
  2. Subtract the count of large rubber spheres from the total.
  3. Subtract the count of big shiny cylinders from the total.
  4. Compute the remaining number of objects.
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure text descriptions are correctly interpreted.
  • Verify that no large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders are present in the image.

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: To compute the remaining number of objects after subtraction.
  • format_final: To format the final answer for output.

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify the number of objects to subtract.
     note: No large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders are present in the image.
  2. (python) Compute the remaining number of objects.
     code: total_objects = 0; large_rubber_spheres = 0; big_shiny_cylinders = 0; remaining_objects = total_objects - large_rubber_spheres - big_shiny_cylinders
  3. (normalize) Format the final answer.
