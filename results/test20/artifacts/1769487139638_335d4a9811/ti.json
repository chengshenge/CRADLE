  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The task is to find the value of m∠H, which is part of a geometric figure. The diagram likely contains angle H, which is marked with a value of 97 degrees. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The correct answer must be selected from these options. The context and position of angle H in the diagram are not fully clear without viewing the image.",
