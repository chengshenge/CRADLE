[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests a geometric diagram is present in the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to identify the measure of a specific angle from a geometric diagram.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['m∠H']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The diagram contains angle H, which is marked with a value of 97 degrees. The options provided match the possible values for angle H.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The image likely contains a geometric diagram with angle H.
  • Angle H is marked with a value of 97 degrees.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact position and context of angle H in the diagram is unknown without viewing the image.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The task is to find the value of m∠H, which is part of a geometric figure. The diagram likely contains angle H, which is marked with a value of 97 degrees. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The correct answer must be selected from these options. The context and position of angle H in the diagram are not fully clear without viewing the image.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify angle H in the diagram
  2. Verify the marked value of angle H
  3. Map the value to the correct option
- blockers: ['m∠H']
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure label-to-segment mapping for angle H is correct
  • Verify angle markers are clear and unambiguous

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • format_final: Format the final answer to match the required output format.
- new_skill_specs:
  • identify_angle_in_diagram (image_hash:str, angle_label:str)->float
  • map_value_to_option (value:float, options:list)->str

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and verify angle H value
     note: The diagram shows angle H marked as 97 degrees. Verify this matches an option.
  2. (reason) Map the verified angle value to the correct option
     note: Angle H is marked as 97 degrees, which corresponds to option A.
  3. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: 97

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify blockers and verify angle H value
  - reason: Map the verified angle value to the correct option
  - normalize: Answer: 97
