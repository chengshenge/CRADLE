  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The triangle's internal angles must sum to 180°, and the angle bisectors create specific relationships between the angles. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options for the value of ∠BOC.",
