  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes point labels A through H and specifically marks angle H with a value of 102 degrees. The task is to identify the measure of angle H, which is a straightforward geometric problem. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The image is necessary to confirm the measure of angle H as it is not described in the text prompt. The known value of angle H is extracted from the image, which directly answers the problem's question.",
