QUESTION: Question: Subtract all large rubber spheres. Subtract all big shiny cylinders. How many objects are left? Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Solution:

[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: text
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['number of objects left']
- unknown: ['number of objects left']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem requires identifying specific objects based on their descriptions, which are likely labeled with text in the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task involves identifying and counting objects based on their descriptions, then performing subtraction to find the remaining number of objects.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: text
- extracted_text_lines: 5
- unresolved_targets: ['number of objects left']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task requires identifying and counting objects based on their descriptions. The text extracted from the image provides the necessary labels to identify the objects mentioned in the problem.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: text
- visual_facts:
  • Three large rubber spheres are visible in the image.
  • Two big shiny cylinders are visible in the image.
  • The total number of objects subtracted is 5.
- ambiguity:
  • The problem does not specify how many of each type of object there are, so this information must be extracted from the image.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves counting and subtracting specific types of objects based on their descriptions. The user is asked to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from a total set of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects are left  ...  image. The known visual facts indicate that there are three large rubber spheres and two big shiny cylinders visible in the image. The total number of objects subtracted is five. The task is to compute the remaining number of objects after these subtractions.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify and count large rubber spheres
  2. Identify and count big shiny cylinders
  3. Subtract the counts of these objects from the total number of objects
- blockers: ['number of objects left']
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure accurate identification of objects based on descriptions
  • Verify the total count of objects before subtraction

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: To perform arithmetic operations such as subtraction.
  • format_final: To format the final answer for output.
- new_skill_specs:
  • count_objects_by_description (image:str, description:str)->int

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and known values
     note: The problem requires subtracting specific objects. Known: 3 large rubber spheres, 2 big shiny cylinders.
  2. (python) Compute remaining objects
     code: total_objects = 5; subtracted_objects = 3 + 2; remaining_objects = total_objects - subtracted_objects
  3. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: {remaining_objects}

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify blockers and known values
  - python: Compute remaining objects
  - normalize: Answer: 0
