  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves counting and subtracting specific types of objects based on their descriptions. The user is asked to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from a total set of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects are left after these subtractions. The problem requires identifying objects by their descriptions, which are likely labeled with text in the image. The known visual facts indicate that there are three large rubber spheres and two big shiny cylinders visible in the image. The total number of objects subtracted is five. The task is to compute the remaining number of objects after these subtractions.",
