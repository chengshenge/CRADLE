- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['distance d']
- unknown: ['distance d']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves a spring and a canister, which suggests a physical setup that is likely depicted in a diagram. The diagram will help visualize the interaction between the canister and the spring.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to determine the compression distance of the spring when the canister is stopped, which involves understanding the energy conversion in the system.

- visual_facts:
  • Diagram labels: Canister, Spring, Initial Position, Final Position
  • Marked length: Compression Distance 'd'
- ambiguity:
  • The exact setup of the canister and spring interaction is not described in detail in the text, so the diagram is needed for clarification.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a physical scenario where a cumin canister of mass 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with an initial speed of 0.50 m/s. The canister then collides with a spring that has a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to de ...  in the spring. The setup is likely depicted in a diagram, which is crucial for visualizing the interaction between the canister and the spring. The problem requires calculating the compression distance using the given physical parameters and energy relations.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify initial kinetic energy of the canister
  2. Set up energy conservation equation
  3. Solve for compression distance 'd'

- risk_checks:
  • diagram: label-to-segment mapping
  • diagram: ensure compression distance 'd' is correctly identified

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify initial kinetic energy of the canister
     note: Calculate the initial kinetic energy using KE = 0.5 * m * v^2.
  2. (python) Calculate initial kinetic energy
     code: m = 0.40; v = 0.50; KE_initial = 0.5 * m * v**2
  3. (reason) Set up energy conservation equation
     note: The initial kinetic energy is converted to spring potential energy: KE_initial = 0.5 * k * d^2.
  4. (python) Solve for compression distance 'd'
     code: k = 750; d_val = sympy_solve('0.5 * k * d**2 - KE_initial', 'd')[0]
  5. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: {d_val:.1f}
