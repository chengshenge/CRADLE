  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual and does not require any visual interpretation. The known elements include angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The solution requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle.",
