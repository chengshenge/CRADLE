[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known elements include angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The problem requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the sum of angles in triangle ABC to find ∠B and ∠C
  2. Apply properties of angle bisectors to find ∠BOC

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: Compute numeric expressions to find the measures of angles B and C using the sum of angles in triangle ABC.
  • format_final: Format the final answer to match the required output format.
- new_skill_specs:
  • find_angle_boc (angle_a, angle_b, angle_c)->angle_boc

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (python) Calculate the sum of angles B and C using the triangle angle sum property.
     code: sum_BC = 180 - 110
  2. (python) Find the measure of angle BOC using the properties of angle bisectors.
     code: angle_BOC = 180 - sum_BC / 2
  3. (normalize) Format the final answer to match the required output format.
