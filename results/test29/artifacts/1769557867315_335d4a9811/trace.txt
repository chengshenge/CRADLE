[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests that the image likely contains a geometric diagram with labeled angles.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task requires identifying the measure of a specific angle from a diagram, which involves understanding geometric properties and possibly using angle sum properties.

- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The diagram contains labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
  • The measure of angle H is unreadable.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact configuration of the diagram is unknown without OCR.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled points, including point H, and possibly other angles that relate to angle H. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is curre ... traints such as the sum of angles in a triangle being 180° if applicable. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options for the measure of angle H. The exact configuration of the diagram is unknown without further visual information.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify the geometric properties and relationships in the diagram
  2. Use angle sum properties or other geometric rules to determine m∠H
  3. Map the computed value to one of the given options
- blockers: ['m∠H is unreadable from the diagram']
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure label-to-segment mapping is correct
  • Check for angle markers and their clarity
  • Verify any parallel/perpendicular indicators if present

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers and constraints
     note: The measure of angle H is unreadable from the diagram.
  2. (reason) Use known constraints to deduce m∠H
     note: Assume angle sum property in a triangle or other geometric rules apply.
  3. (reason) Select the most reasonable option based on typical angle measures
     note: Choose the option that is most likely given typical geometric configurations.
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer
