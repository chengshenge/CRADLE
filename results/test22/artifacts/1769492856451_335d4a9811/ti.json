  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram contains labeled angles, including angle H, which is marked with a value of 102 degrees. The task is to confirm this measure and map it to the provided multiple-choice options. The problem is set in a geometric context, likely involving relationships between angles. The sum of angles in a triangle constraint may apply if the diagram is a triangle. The problem requires identifying the correct measure of angle H and selecting the corresponding option from the choices given.",
