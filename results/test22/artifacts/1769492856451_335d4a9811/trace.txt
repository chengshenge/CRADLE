[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: yes
- asks: ['m∠H']
- unknown: ['m∠H']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves finding the measure of an angle, which suggests that the image likely contains a geometric diagram with labeled angles.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task is to identify the measure of a specific angle from a geometric diagram, which requires understanding the relationships between angles in the figure.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['m∠H']
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves identifying the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram.
  • The diagram contains labeled points and angles, with angle H specifically marked.
  • Options for the measure of angle H are provided, and the correct value is extracted from the diagram.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • The diagram contains labeled angles A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
  • Angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact relationships between angles in the diagram are not specified in the prompt.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram contains labeled angles, including angle H, which is marked with a value of 102 degrees. The task is to confirm this measure and map it to the provided multiple-choic ... xt, likely involving relationships between angles. The sum of angles in a triangle constraint may apply if the diagram is a triangle. The problem requires identifying the correct measure of angle H and selecting the corresponding option from the choices given.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify angle H in the diagram
  2. Verify the marked value of angle H
  3. Map the value to the multiple-choice options
- risk_checks:
  • diagram: label-to-segment mapping
  • diagram: angle markers

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify the measure of angle H from the diagram.
     note: Angle H is marked with a value of 102 degrees in the diagram.
  2. (reason) Map the identified angle measure to the multiple-choice options.
     note: The value 102 matches option B.
  3. (python) Format the final answer using the identified option.
     code: format_final(102)

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify the measure of angle H from the diagram.
  - reason: Map the identified angle measure to the multiple-choice options.
  - python: Format the final answer using the identified option.
