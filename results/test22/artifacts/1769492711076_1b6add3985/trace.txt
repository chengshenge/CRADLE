[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a cumin canister of mass 0.40 kg sliding across a horizontal frictionless counter with an initial speed of 0.50 m/s. The canister then compresses a spring with a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to determine the distance by which th ...  canister into the potential energy of the spring. The setup is likely depicted in a diagram showing the canister, spring, initial position, and final position. The compression distance 'd' is marked on the diagram, which is the unknown value to be determined.

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify initial kinetic energy of the canister
     note: Use the formula KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2 to find the initial kinetic energy.
  2. (python) Compute initial kinetic energy
     code: mass = 0.40; velocity = 0.50; KE_initial = 0.5 * mass * velocity**2
  3. (reason) Set up energy conservation equation
     note: The initial kinetic energy is converted to spring potential energy: KE_initial = 0.5 * k * d^2.
  4. (python) Solve for compression distance d
     code: k = 750; d_val = sympy_solve('0.5 * 750 * d**2 - KE_initial', 'd')[0]
  5. (normalize) Format the final answer for compression distance
     text: Answer: {d_val:.1f}
