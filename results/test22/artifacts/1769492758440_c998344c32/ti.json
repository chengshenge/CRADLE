  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup is likely labeled with volume markings, which are visible in the image. The task is to extract the total volume from these markings. The image contains text markings indicating volume measurements such as 250 ml, 500 ml, 750 ml, and 1000 ml. The largest visible marking is 1000 ml, which likely represents the total volume of the measuring cup. However, the unit specified in the question is grams, which is unusual for volume, suggesting a need to interpret the image markings carefully. The answer should be provided as an integer value.",
