[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two internal angle bisectors OB and OC intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the user prompt. The options for the unknown angle ∠BOC are given as multiple-choice answers. The solution requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the properties of angle bisectors in a triangle
  2. Apply the triangle angle sum property
  3. Calculate ∠BOC

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify the known angle and properties of the triangle.
     note: ∠A = 110°; OB and OC are angle bisectors intersecting at O.
  2. (reason) Use triangle angle sum property and bisector properties.
     note: In △ABC, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°. OB and OC bisect ∠B and ∠C.
  3. (python) Calculate ∠BOC using angle bisector properties.
     code: angle_BC = 180 - 110; angle_BOC = 180 - (angle_BC / 2)
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer based on the calculated angle.
     text: Answer: 145°

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify the known angle and properties of the triangle.
  - reason: Use triangle angle sum property and bisector properties.
  - python: Calculate ∠BOC using angle bisector properties.
  - normalize: Answer: 145°
