  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. The given information includes that angle ∠A is 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The angle bisectors OB and OC divide angles ∠B and ∠C respectively. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, which is a key constraint in solving the problem. The solution requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and their intersection in a triangle.",
