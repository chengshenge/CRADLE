  "problem_state_summary": "A cumin canister with a mass of 0.40 kg slides across a frictionless counter at a speed of 0.50 m/s. It collides with a spring that has a spring constant of 750 N/m. The task is to determine the distance by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped. The problem involves the conversion of kinetic energy of the canister into the potential energy of the spring. The setup is likely depicted in a diagram showing the canister, the spring, and possibly the compression distance. The problem requires calculating the compression distance using the given values.",
