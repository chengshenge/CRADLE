  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric scenario with triangle △ABC. Two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The given information includes angle ∠A, which measures 110°. The task is to determine the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the value of ∠BOC. The known geometric property is that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. The solution requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and their impact on the angles within the triangle.",
