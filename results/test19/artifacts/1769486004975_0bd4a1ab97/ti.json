  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves counting objects and performing arithmetic operations based on their descriptions. Specifically, the task is to subtract all objects that are large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The image likely contains labeled objects with descriptions such as 'large rubber spheres' and 'big shiny cylinders'. The total number of objects subtracted is 5, as identified by the counts of 3 large rubber spheres and 2 big shiny cylinders. The problem requires reading text labels or descriptions from the image to identify and count the objects accurately.",
