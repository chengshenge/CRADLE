  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a spatial comparison between two groups of objects depicted in a diagram. Specifically, it asks whether the number of tiny gray bicycles located on the left side of a brown metal sedan is greater than the number of objects located to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The task requires identifying and counting these objects within the diagram. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The solution involves determining the counts of the specified objects and comparing them to answer the question. The diagram is essential for visualizing the positions and counts of the objects. The problem is straightforward once the objects are identified and counted correctly.",
