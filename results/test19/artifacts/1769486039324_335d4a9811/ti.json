  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram contains labeled angles, including A, B, C, and H, among others. The known angles are ∠A = 45°, ∠B = 60°, and ∠C = 75°, and they form a triangle with a sum of 180°. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is related to these angles. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the measure of angle H. The exact relationships between angle H and the other angles are not specified in the text, which requires careful analysis of the diagram.",
