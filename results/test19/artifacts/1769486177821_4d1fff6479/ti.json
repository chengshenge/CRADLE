  "problem_state_summary": "The problem presents a geometric figure known as a '勾股树', which consists of squares and right triangles. The areas of two squares, labeled A and B, are given as 5 and 3 square units, respectively. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled C. The geometric configuration suggests the use of the Pythagorean theorem, as the figure is composed of right triangles and squares. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options for the area of square C. The solution requires understanding the spatial relationships between the squares and applying geometric principles to find the unknown area.",
