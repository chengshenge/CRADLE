  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves interpreting the time shown on a clock face and expressing it in words. The user is asked to determine what time is shown and select the correct verbal description from the provided options. The clock face is a diagrammatic representation with labels for each hour. The task is to read the time from the clock and match it to one of the given options. The options include various common time expressions. The problem requires understanding the position of the clock hands to determine the correct time expression.",
