  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4.0 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the length of AC. The solution requires understanding the relationship between the given segments and the midpoint property to find the unknown length.",
