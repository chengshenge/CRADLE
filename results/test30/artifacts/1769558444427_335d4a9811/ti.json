  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain labeled points, including point H, where the angle measure is required. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is related to other angles or geometric properties in the diagram. The measure of angle H is currently unreadable in the diagram, creating a challenge in directly obtaining the value. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The final answer must be mapped to one of these options.",
