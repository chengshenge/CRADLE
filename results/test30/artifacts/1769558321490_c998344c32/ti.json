  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup. The measuring cup is likely depicted in the image as a diagram with volume markings. The task is to find the total volume, which is indicated by these markings. The known information extracted from the image is a maximum marking of 500. The question requires an integer answer representing the total volume in grams. The image is unreadable, which poses a challenge in extracting the necessary information to solve the problem.",
