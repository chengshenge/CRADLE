QUESTION: Question: Subtract all large rubber spheres. Subtract all big shiny cylinders. How many objects are left? Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Solution:

[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: no
- asks: ['number of objects left']
- unknown: ['number of objects left']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves counting objects and determining their characteristics (large, rubber, shiny, cylinders, spheres), which suggests a need to analyze the spatial arrangement and properties of objects in the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task requires identifying and counting specific types of objects based on their attributes, which involves visual inspection and categorization.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- readability_issues:
  • unreadable
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves counting specific objects based on their attributes, but the image is unreadable, preventing extraction of labels or numbers.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • Objects are visually distinguishable by size, material, and shape
  • The image does not clearly show large rubber spheres.
  • The image does not clearly show big shiny cylinders.
- ambiguity:
  • The definitions of 'large', 'rubber', 'big', and 'shiny' may vary and need to be visually interpreted.
  • The image does not provide enough clarity to count the specified objects.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves analyzing a diagram to count the remaining objects after removing specific types. The task is to subtract all large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The image is supposed to show objects categorized  ... g shiny cylinders, making it difficult to perform the required subtractions. The task requires visual inspection and categorization of objects based on their attributes. The final goal is to determine how many objects are left after the specified subtractions.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify large rubber spheres in the diagram
  2. Identify big shiny cylinders in the diagram
  3. Subtract identified large rubber spheres from total
  4. Subtract identified big shiny cylinders from total
  5. Count remaining objects
- blockers: ['The image does not clearly show large rubber spheres', 'The image does not clearly show big shiny cylinders']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • clarity of object attributes like size, material, and shape

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers in the problem.
     note: The image does not clearly show large rubber spheres or big shiny cylinders.
  2. (reason) Determine the number of objects left.
     note: Since the image is unreadable, we cannot determine the number of objects left.
  3. (normalize) Output the result based on available information.
