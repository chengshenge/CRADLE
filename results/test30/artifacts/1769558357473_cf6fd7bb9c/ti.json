  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. The given information includes that angle ∠A is 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the answer. The diagram likely shows the triangle with labeled points and angle bisectors, but the exact values of angles ∠B and ∠C are not directly given. The sum of the angles in the triangle is constrained to 180°, which is a key relation to use. The problem requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and how they relate to the angles in the triangle.",
