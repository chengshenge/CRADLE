  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The task is to find the value of angle H, which is likely part of a geometric figure shown in the image. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The diagram is expected to contain angle H, which is marked with a value of 97 degrees. The options provided are 97, 102, 107, and 122. The task is straightforward as it involves identifying the correct measure of angle H from the diagram and mapping it to one of the given options.",
