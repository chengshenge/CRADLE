  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC with two angle bisectors OB and OC intersecting at point O. The given information is that angle ∠A is 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The angle bisectors OB and OC create a specific geometric configuration that must be used to determine the unknown angle. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options for the value of ∠BOC.",
