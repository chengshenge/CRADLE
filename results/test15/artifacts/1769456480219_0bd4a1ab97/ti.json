  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining how many objects remain after subtracting specific types of objects from a total set. The total number of objects is given as 20. Among these, there are 5 large rubber spheres and 3 big shiny cylinders. The task is to subtract these specific objects from the total to find the remaining number of objects. The problem requires basic arithmetic operations to solve. The visual information confirms the counts of the objects to be subtracted. The final answer should be an integer representing the remaining objects.",
