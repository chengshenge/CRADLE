  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where the angle bisectors of angles B and C, denoted as OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the measure of angle BOC. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC, which needs to be computed using the properties of angle bisectors and the triangle angle sum property.",
