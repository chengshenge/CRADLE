  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H, which is likely part of a geometric figure. The task is to identify the correct measure from the given multiple-choice options. The problem suggests a geometric context, possibly involving a diagram with angles and labels. The choices provided indicate that the measure of angle H is one of the given options. The problem is straightforward, requiring the identification of the angle measure from a diagram. The specific geometric context or additional information about angle H is not provided in the text.",
