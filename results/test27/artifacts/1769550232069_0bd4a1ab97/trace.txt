QUESTION: Question: Subtract all large rubber spheres. Subtract all big shiny cylinders. How many objects are left? Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end. Solution:

[IG] Information Gathering
- region_to_detect: diagram
- focus_bbox: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | focus_zoom: 1.0
- need_ocr: no
- asks: ['number of objects left']
- unknown: ['number of objects left']
- reasoning_of_region:
  • The problem involves counting objects and determining their attributes (large, rubber, shiny, cylinders, spheres), which requires analyzing the spatial arrangement and characteristics of objects in the image.
- reasoning_of_task:
  • The task requires identifying and counting specific types of objects based on their attributes, which is a spatial and visual reasoning task.

[GTI] Gather Text/Values
- region_used: diagram
- extracted_text_lines: 0
- unresolved_targets: ['number of objects left']
- readability_issues:
  • unreadable
- gti_reasoning:
  • The task involves counting specific objects based on their attributes, but the image is unreadable, preventing extraction of relevant information.

[IGR] IG Refine (merged IG+GTI)
- region_to_detect: diagram
- visual_facts:
  • Objects have attributes such as size, material, and shape.
  • The image does not clearly show large rubber spheres.
  • The image does not clearly show big shiny cylinders.
- ambiguity:
  • The exact criteria for 'large', 'rubber', 'big', and 'shiny' are not specified.
  • The image is unreadable, preventing extraction of relevant information.

[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a diagram where the task is to count the remaining objects after removing those that are large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders. The user is asked to determine how many objects are left after these subtractions. The problem requires  ...  it difficult to perform the required subtractions. The exact criteria for 'large', 'rubber', 'big', and 'shiny' are not specified, adding to the ambiguity. The image is unreadable, preventing the extraction of relevant information needed to solve the problem.
- required_operations:
  1. Identify large rubber spheres
  2. Identify big shiny cylinders
  3. Subtract identified objects from total
  4. Count remaining objects
- blockers: ['number of objects left']
- risk_checks:
  • label-to-segment mapping
  • unreadable image preventing object identification

[SC] Skill Curation
- new_skill_specs:

  • count_remaining_objects (total_objects:int, objects_to_subtract:List[Dict[str, Any]])->int

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (reason) Identify blockers due to unreadable image.
     note: The image is unreadable, preventing extraction of relevant information.
  2. (normalize) Conclude based on inability to extract data.
     text: Answer: Unable to determine due to unreadable image.

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - reason: Identify blockers due to unreadable image.
  - normalize: Answer: Unable to determine due to unreadable image.

[SR] Self-Reflection / Answer Polishing
- confidence: 0.0

[FINAL]
- final_answer: Answer: Unable to determine due to unreadable image.
