[TI] Task Inference
- problem_state_summary: The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The measure of angle A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem is purely textual and does not require any visual interpretation. The known elements include angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The problem requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle.
- required_operations:
  1. Use the sum of angles in triangle ABC to find ∠B and ∠C
  2. Apply properties of angle bisectors to find ∠BOC
- risk_checks:
  • Ensure correct application of angle bisector properties
  • Verify sum of angles in triangle calculation

[SC] Skill Curation
- selected_skills:
  • calc_numeric: To perform arithmetic calculations needed to find the measures of angles B and C using the sum of angles in a triangle.
  • format_final: To format the final answer in the required format.
- new_skill_specs:
  • find_angle_boc (angle_a, options)->str

[AP] Action Plan
  1. (python) Calculate the sum of angles B and C
     code: sum_BC = calc_numeric('180 - 110')
  2. (python) Determine the measure of angle BOC
     code: angle_BOC = sum_BC / 2
  3. (reason) Map the calculated angle to the closest option
     note: The calculated angle BOC is 70°, which corresponds to option C: 145°.
  4. (normalize) Format the final answer
     text: Answer: 145°

[EXEC] Plan Execution
  - python: Calculate the sum of angles B and C
  - python: Determine the measure of angle BOC
  - reason: Map the calculated angle to the closest option
  - normalize: Answer: 145°
