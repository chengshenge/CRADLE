  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying and subtracting specific types of objects from a total set to determine how many are left. The objects in question are large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders. The task requires counting these objects based on their descriptions and performing subtraction. The total number of objects subtracted is given as 5. The problem asks for the number of objects remaining after these subtractions. The solution requires an integer answer, indicating the final count of objects left.",
