  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a diagram. The diagram is expected to contain geometric elements, including angle H, which is marked but not directly readable. The task is to identify the correct measure of angle H from the given multiple-choice options. The options provided are 97, 102, 107, and 122 degrees. The problem is a typical geometry question where the measure of an angle must be inferred from visual information. The exact measure of angle H is not directly visible, creating a need for further analysis or inference from the diagram.",
