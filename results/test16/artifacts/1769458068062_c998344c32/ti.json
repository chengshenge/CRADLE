  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup, which is likely indicated on the image as text. The measuring cup has volume markings at 250 g, 500 g, 750 g, and 1000 g. The task is to identify the total volume from these markings. The unit specified is grams (g), which is unusual for volume, suggesting a need to interpret the image correctly. The largest visible marking is 1000 g, which may represent the total capacity. The problem requires an integer answer, and the final value should be provided as such.",
