  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two of its internal angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known elements include the angle ∠A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown element is the angle ∠BOC, which needs to be calculated using the given information. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options to choose from.",
