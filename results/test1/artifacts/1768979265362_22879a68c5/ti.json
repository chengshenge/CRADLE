  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves interpreting a clock diagram to determine the time word that fits the sentence 'It is (_) after eight'. The clock diagram shows the positions of the hour and minute hands, which must be analyzed to identify the correct time word. The time word must be selected from the given options. The task requires understanding the geometric representation of the clock and mapping it to the appropriate time word. The problem is a multiple-choice question with five options. The exact positions of the clock hands need to be interpreted to determine the correct time word.",
