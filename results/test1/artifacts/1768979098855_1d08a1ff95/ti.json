  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC with two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersecting at point O. The angle at vertex A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC, which is formed by the intersection of the angle bisectors OB and OC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the value of angle BOC. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is constrained to 180 degrees. The problem does not directly specify the measures of angles B and C, which adds some ambiguity.",
