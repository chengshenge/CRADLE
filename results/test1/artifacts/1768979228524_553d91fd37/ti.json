  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric configuration with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The lengths of segments CB and DB are given as 4 cm and 7 cm, respectively. Point D is specified as the midpoint of segment AC. The task is to determine the length of segment AC using the given information. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the length of AC. The diagram is crucial for confirming the geometric configuration and any additional labels or points that may affect the solution.",
