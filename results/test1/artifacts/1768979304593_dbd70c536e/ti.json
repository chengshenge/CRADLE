  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram where specific objects, including a brown metal sedan, tiny gray bicycles, and a tiny green bicycle, are depicted. The task is to compare the number of tiny gray bicycles located on the left side of the brown metal sedan with the number of objects positioned to the left of the tiny green bicycle. The question asks whether the former count is greater than the latter. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The spatial relationships and positions of these objects need to be determined from the diagram to answer the question accurately.",
