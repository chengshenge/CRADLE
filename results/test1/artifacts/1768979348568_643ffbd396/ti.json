  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure known as a Pythagorean tree, which consists of squares and right triangles. In this configuration, all quadrilaterals are squares, and all triangles are right triangles. The areas of two squares, A and B, are provided as 5 and 3 square units, respectively. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled C, using the geometric properties inherent in the Pythagorean tree. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the area of square C. The solution requires understanding the geometric relationships between the squares and triangles in the diagram.",
