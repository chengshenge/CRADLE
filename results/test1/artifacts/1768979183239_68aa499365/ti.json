  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes labeled points and angles, with angle H specifically marked with a value of 102°. The task is to identify this measure and select the correct option from the provided choices. The choices are numerical values, suggesting that the answer is a specific angle measurement. The problem is straightforward as the diagram directly provides the value of angle H. The context is geometric, focusing on angle identification within a diagram.",
