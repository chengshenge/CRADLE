The given figure is a \"Pythagorean tree,\" where each set of squares and the right triangle they form follow the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. **Identify the sides of the squares:**\n   - Square A has an area of 5, so its side length is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n   - Square B has an area of 3, so its side length is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**\n   The side of square C is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the sides of squares A and B. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   (\\text{Side of C})^2 = (\\text{Side of A})^2 + (\\text{Side of B})^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (\\text{Side of C})^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (\\text{Side of C})^2 = 5 + 3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of square C:**\n   The area of square C is the square of its side length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of C} = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the largest square C is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
