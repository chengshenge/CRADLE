Therefore, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of \u2220ABC, which is 2 \u00d7 60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0.\n\nSince \u2220ADC is also an inscribed angle subtending the same arc AC, \u2220ADC is equal to \u2220ABC, which is 60\u00b0.\n\nNow, \u2220CDE is an exterior angle to triangle ADC, and it is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles, \u2220DAC and \u2220ADC. Since \u2220DAC is also an inscribed angle subtending arc DC, and arc DC is the remaining part of the circle (360\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 240\u00b0), \u2220DAC is half of arc DC, which is 240\u00b0/2 = 120\u00b0.\n\nThus, \u2220CDE = \u2220DAC + \u2220ADC = 120\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect because \u2220CDE should be smaller.
