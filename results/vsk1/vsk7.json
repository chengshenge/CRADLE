        "question": "When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

        "response": "THOUGHT 0: This problem involves the conservation of energy. The initial kinetic energy of the cumin canister is converted into the potential energy stored in the spring when it is compressed. We can use the formula for kinetic energy and the formula for the potential energy of a spring to find the distance \\( d \\) by which the spring is compressed.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy \\( KE \\) of the canister is given by:\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nThe potential energy \\( PE \\) stored in the spring when compressed by distance \\( d \\) is:\n\\[ PE = \\frac{1}{2} k d^2 \\]\n\nBy conservation of energy, the initial kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy at maximum compression:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k d^2 \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for \\( d \\).\n\nACTION 0: No action needed.\nANSWER: The distance \\( d \\) by which the spring is compressed is given by:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{m v^2}{k}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ m = 0.40 \\, \\text{kg}, \\, v = 0.50 \\, \\text{m/s}, \\, k = 750 \\, \\text{N/m} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.40 \\times (0.50)^2}{750}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.40 \\times 0.25}{750}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.10}{750}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{0.0001333} \\]\n\n\\[ d \\approx 0.0115 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo, the spring is compressed by approximately 0.0115 meters.",
