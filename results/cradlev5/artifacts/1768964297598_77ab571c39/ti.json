  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals, Alice and Bob, whose ages are provided in an image. Alice is 30 years old, and Bob is 25 years old. The task requires extracting these ages from the image and calculating the difference between them. The image is assumed to contain clear text indicating these ages. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years. The problem is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations.",
