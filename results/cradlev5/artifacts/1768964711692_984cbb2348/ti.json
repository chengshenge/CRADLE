  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual comparison task where the user must determine if the number of gray rubber objects located in front of a small yellow aeroplane is greater than the number of big cyan matte fighters. The task requires identifying and counting these specific objects based on their attributes, such as color, size, and material. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The visual information necessary to solve the problem is contained within a diagram, which requires careful observation to count the objects accurately. The problem does not provide explicit numerical data, so the user must rely on visual inspection to make the comparison. The task is straightforward but requires attention to detail to ensure the correct objects are counted and compared.",
