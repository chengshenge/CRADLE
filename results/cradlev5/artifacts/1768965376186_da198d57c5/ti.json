  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the perimeter of a square. The square is depicted in a diagram with points labeled A, B, C, and D. The side length of the square, specifically segment AB, is marked as 5 cm in the diagram. The task requires calculating the perimeter using this side length. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. The problem is straightforward, but the side length must be extracted from the image as it is not provided in the text. The final answer should be an integer value representing the perimeter.",
