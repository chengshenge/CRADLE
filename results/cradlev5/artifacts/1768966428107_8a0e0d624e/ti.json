  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the average miles per gallon that a city bus gets. The information is presented in text form, and the specific numerical value is extracted from the text. The task is straightforward as it requires identifying a specific numerical value related to fuel efficiency. The text explicitly states the average miles per gallon for a city bus, which is the target information needed. The problem does not involve any complex calculations or additional data interpretation. The final answer should be provided as an integer value.",
