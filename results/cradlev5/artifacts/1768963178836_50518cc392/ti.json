  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing the quantities of two types of objects: metallic fighters and rubber objects. The image provides the numbers for these objects, with 15 metallic fighters and 20 rubber objects. The task is to determine if there are fewer metallic fighters than rubber objects. This is a straightforward comparison problem where the quantities are directly given. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format, requiring the selection of the correct option based on the comparison. The answer must be mapped to one of the provided options, either 'Yes' or 'No'.",
