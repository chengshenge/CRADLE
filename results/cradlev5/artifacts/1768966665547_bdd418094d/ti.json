  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure, specifically triangle ABC with a point D inside it. CD bisects angle ACB, and BD is perpendicular to CD. It is given that angle A equals angle ABD, and angle DBC is 54 degrees. The task is to determine the measure of angle A. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes points labeled A, B, C, and D, and angles labeled ∠ACB, ∠ABD, and ∠DBC. The relationships between the lines and angles are crucial for solving the problem. The problem is multiple-choice with four options for the measure of angle A.",
