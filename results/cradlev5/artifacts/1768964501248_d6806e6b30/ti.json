  "problem_state_summary": "The problem presents a scenario where all spider eggs are eaten by predators, and it asks for the impact on the population of adult spiders. The question is structured as a multiple-choice question with four options. The task is to logically deduce the effect on the adult spider population based on the given scenario. There is no specific numerical data provided, making it a logical deduction problem. The problem requires understanding the life cycle or population dynamics of spiders to determine the outcome. The options suggest different possible outcomes for the adult spider population, including remaining the same, doubling, decreasing, or increasing.",
