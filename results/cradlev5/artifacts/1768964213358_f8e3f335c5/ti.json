  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining whether a function is odd or even based on its graphical representation. The graph is titled 'Function Graph' with x-axis labeled as 'x' and y-axis labeled as 'f(x)'. The x-axis and y-axis both have ticks ranging from -3 to 3. There is no legend provided. The task requires analyzing the symmetry of the graph to decide if the function is odd or even. The function type is not specified in the text and must be inferred from the graph. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: odd or even.",
