  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram containing various objects, including yellow matte blocks and tiny brown cylinders. The task is to count these specific types of objects and subtract them from the total number of objects in the diagram. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem requires visual identification and counting of the specified objects. The exact number of each type of object is not provided in the text and must be determined from the image. The final answer should be an integer representing the remaining number of objects.",
