  "problem_state_summary": "A cumin canister with a mass of 0.40 kg slides across a horizontal frictionless counter at a speed of 0.50 m/s. It collides with a spring that has a spring constant of 750 N/m, causing the spring to compress. The task is to determine the distance 'd' by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped. The problem involves the conversion of the canister's kinetic energy into the potential energy of the spring. The setup is depicted in a diagram with labels A, B, and C, where AB is the compression distance and BC is marked as 0.50 m. The counter is frictionless, which simplifies the energy conservation calculations.",
