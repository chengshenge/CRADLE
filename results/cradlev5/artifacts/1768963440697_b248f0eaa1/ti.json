  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying the highest amount measured by a class, as represented in a chart. The chart is titled 'Amounts Measured by Class' and includes three classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Each class measures three types of measurements: Length, Weight, and Volume. The Y-axis represents the amount in units, with ticks at intervals of 10 from 0 to 50. The task is to determine which class and measurement type combination yields the highest amount. This requires examining the key points provided for each class and measurement type to find the maximum value.",
