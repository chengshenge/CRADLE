  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying which cat is larger from a list of options. The options are labeled as 'white five', 'white three', 'white four', 'white one', and 'white two'. The image associated with the problem likely contains text labels or descriptions that correspond to each of these options. The task is to read these labels and determine which cat is the largest. The problem does not specify how the size of the cats is determined, whether by visual comparison or by reading specific measurements or descriptions. The answer must be provided as the correct option letter, such as A, B, C, D, or E.",
