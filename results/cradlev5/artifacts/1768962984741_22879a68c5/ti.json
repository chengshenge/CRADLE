  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the time shown on a clock, which is typically represented as a diagram with clock hands. The task is to interpret the position of the clock hands to determine the time word that fits the sentence 'It is (_) after eight.' The time must be expressed as a word from the given options. The clock face is a diagram with numbers representing hours. The exact position of the clock hands needs to be determined to choose the correct time word. The problem asks for the time shown on a clock and requires selecting the correct time word from the given options.",
