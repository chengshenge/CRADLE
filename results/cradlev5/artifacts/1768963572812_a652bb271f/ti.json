  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing the derivative of a function f(x) at two specific points, x=2 and x=5. The task is to determine whether the derivative at x=2 is larger than, equal to, or smaller than the derivative at x=5. This requires examining a graph of the function to understand the slope at these points. The graph provides key points at x=2 and x=5, which are essential for determining the slope. The exact values of the derivatives are not given, so interpretation from the graph is necessary. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with three options to choose from.",
