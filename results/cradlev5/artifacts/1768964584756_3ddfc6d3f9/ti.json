  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric diagram with labeled points and angles. The task is to find the measure of angle 3, denoted as m ∠3, using the information provided in the diagram. The diagram includes point labels A, B, C, and D, and angle labels ∠1, ∠2, and ∠3. The known angles are m ∠1 = 90° and m ∠2 = 52°. The goal is to determine the measure of angle 3 and select the correct option from the given choices: 28, 38, 52, or 62. The relationships between the angles are not explicitly provided, which may require additional reasoning based on the diagram's structure.",
