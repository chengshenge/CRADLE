  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a food web diagram to determine the impact of a decrease in the population of large roach on other species. The food web is a diagram that shows relationships between different species, including steelheads, stickleback fry, predatory insects, and large roach. The task is to predict the changes in populations of steelheads, stickleback fry, and predatory insects if the number of large roach decreases. The relationships in the food web are indicated by arrows, which suggest dependencies between species. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options, each describing a potential outcome for one of the species. The correct answer must be selected based on the understanding of the food web dynamics.",
