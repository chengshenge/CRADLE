  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a bar chart titled 'Values of Different Bars'. The chart has bars labeled A to E, each with a specific value. The task is to determine how many of these bars have values smaller than 6. The values of the bars are as follows: A has a value of 5, B has a value of 3, C has a value of 7, D has a value of 2, and E has a value of 6. The Y-axis is labeled 'Values' with ticks at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The X-axis is labeled 'Categories'. The goal is to count the number of bars with values less than 6.",
