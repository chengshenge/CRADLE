  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the limit of a function as x approaches -1. The provided image contains a graph of the function, which must be analyzed to find the limit. The graph is titled 'Graph of f(x)' and has labeled axes for x and f(x) with ticks ranging from -3 to 3. A key point is marked at x = -1, y = 2, which is noted as a point of interest for determining the limit. The task requires finding the limit value as x approaches -1, and the answer must be an integer. The specific function is not mentioned, so the graph must be used to deduce the limit.",
