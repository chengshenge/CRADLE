  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual representation where various objects are depicted. The task is to count the total number of objects and then subtract the number of small balls and blue rubber things from this total. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The characteristics of 'small balls' and 'blue rubber things' need to be identified visually in the image. The problem requires an integer answer representing the remaining number of objects. The solution involves visual identification and counting of specific object types.",
