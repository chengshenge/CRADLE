  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a rhombus ABCD with points E and F as midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. The lengths of AB and AC are given as 5 and 6 units, respectively. The task is to determine the length of segment EF. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes labels for points A, B, C, D, E, and F. The diagram is crucial for understanding the geometric configuration and solving for EF. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options for the length of EF.",
