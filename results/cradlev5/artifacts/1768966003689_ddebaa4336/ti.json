  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the value of r at a specific angle theta in a polar coordinate system. The angle theta is given as 3*pi/2 radians. The task is to find the corresponding value of r on a polar plot that shows the relationship between r and theta. The chart provided is titled 'Polar Plot of r vs. θ' and includes axes labeled with theta in radians and r. A key point on the chart indicates that at theta = 3*pi/2, the value of r is 2. The problem requires identifying this value from the chart and confirming it as the solution.",
