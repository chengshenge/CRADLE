  "problem_state_summary": "The problem presents two diagrams showing pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each diagram uses colored balls to represent gas particles, and both samples have the same number of particles. The task is to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample and determine which sample has the higher temperature. The relationship between kinetic energy and temperature is implied, but not visually specified. The problem is multiple-choice, requiring selection of the correct option based on the comparison of the diagrams.",
