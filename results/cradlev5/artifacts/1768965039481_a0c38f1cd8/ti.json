  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with a diameter AB and a chord CD. The angle ∠ADC is given as 26 degrees. The task is to find the degree of angle ∠CAB. The circle's diameter implies that AB passes through the center O. The relationship between ∠ADC and ∠CAB is governed by circle theorems. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the answer. The diagram is essential to understand the geometric relationships and solve for the unknown angle.",
