  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a right triangle with a 60° angle, where the vertex A of the 60° angle and the right angle vertex C are on two parallel lines FG and DE, respectively. The hypotenuse AB bisects ∠CAG and intersects line DE at point H. The task is to find the measure of ∠BCH. The diagram includes labels for points A, B, C, G, H, F, D, and E, and marks the angle ∠CAB as 60°. The relationship that AB bisects ∠CAG and the parallel nature of lines FG and DE are also indicated. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options for the measure of ∠BCH.",
