  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying and subtracting specific objects based on their attributes from a given list. The objects are described by their color, size, and material. The task is to subtract all objects that are big red metallic spheres and big brown matte things. After subtracting these objects, the goal is to determine how many objects remain. The problem requires careful reading of the object descriptions to ensure the correct objects are subtracted. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
