  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying digits on either end of a sign located in the corner of an image. The task is to calculate the sum of these digits. The image contains a sign with the numbers '123' and '456' on either end. The problem requires reading these specific digits and performing a simple arithmetic operation to find their sum. The digits are assumed to be visible and correctly identified. The final answer should be an integer representing the sum of these digits.",
