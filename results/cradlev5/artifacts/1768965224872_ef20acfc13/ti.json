  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a set of objects that are visually represented in a diagram. The task is to identify and subtract specific objects based on their color, size, and material properties. Specifically, the problem requires subtracting all red matte cubes and all small green metal objects from the total set of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem is presented in a way that necessitates visual inspection to identify the objects that meet the given criteria. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
