  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric configuration with points A, B, C, and D on circle O, and point E on the extended line of AD. The angle ∠ABC is given as 60 degrees. The task is to determine the degree of angle ∠CDE. The diagram is crucial for understanding the relationships between the points and angles. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the answer. The known angle and the geometric configuration suggest using properties of circles and triangles to find the unknown angle.",
