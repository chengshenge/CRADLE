  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a food web diagram to determine the impact on various species if all the algae die due to pesticides. The food web is represented as a diagram with species such as algae, crabs, limpets, dolphins, sea gulls, and star fish. Arrows in the diagram indicate the relationships between these species. The task is to understand these relationships to predict the consequences of the algae's extinction. The problem provides multiple-choice options regarding the potential outcomes for different species. The goal is to select the correct option based on the food web's structure and dependencies.",
