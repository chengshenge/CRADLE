  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining whether a given function is continuous at each point. The function's graph is provided, labeled as 'Function Continuity Analysis', with the x-axis labeled as 'x' and the y-axis labeled as 'f(x)'. The x-axis has ticks at -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, while the y-axis has ticks at -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. Key points on the graph include (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, -1). The task is to analyze the graph to check for any discontinuities, such as breaks, jumps, or holes, at each point. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: (A) Yes, the function is continuous at each point, or (B) No, the function is not continuous at each point.",
