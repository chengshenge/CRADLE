  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals based on their ages provided in an image. The image contains text lines that specify the ages of Person 1 and Person 2. Person 1 is 35 years old, and Person 2 is 28 years old. The task is to calculate the difference between these two ages to find the age gap. The problem requires extracting numerical information from the image and performing a simple arithmetic operation. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years.",
