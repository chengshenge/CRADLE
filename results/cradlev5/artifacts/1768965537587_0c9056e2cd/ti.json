  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle is depicted in a diagram with its sides labeled as AB, BC, CD, and DA. The lengths of sides AB and BC are provided as 5 cm and 3 cm, respectively. The task is to determine the perimeter using these dimensions. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by summing the lengths of all sides, which can be simplified to 2 times the sum of the length and width. The dimensions are extracted from the diagram, as they are not provided in the text. The final answer should be an integer value representing the perimeter.",
