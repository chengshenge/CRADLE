  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric transformation where a sector of a circle with a central angle of 120 degrees and a radius of 6 cm is rolled into a conical shape. The task is to determine the perimeter of the base of the resulting cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The problem is presented with a diagram that likely shows the sector and/or the resulting cone. The solution requires understanding the relationship between the sector's arc length and the cone's base perimeter. The problem is multiple-choice with four options provided.",
