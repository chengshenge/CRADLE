  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes point labels A through H and angle labels corresponding to these points. The specific task is to find the measure of angle H, which is marked in the diagram. The image shows that angle H is 102 degrees. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The correct measure of angle H must be selected from these options.",
