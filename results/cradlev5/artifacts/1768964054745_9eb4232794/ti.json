  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with center O, where AB is the diameter. There are two chords, EF and EB, and point E is the midpoint of FEB. The chord EF intersects the diameter AB at point C, and line OF is connected. The angle AOF is given as 40 degrees. The task is to determine the measure of angle F. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the answer.",
