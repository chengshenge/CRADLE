  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle ∠A is given as 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem is purely textual, and all necessary information is provided in the prompt. The known elements include the angle ∠A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The relationship between the angles in the triangle is governed by the constraint that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. The problem asks for the calculation of angle ∠BOC, which is influenced by the properties of angle bisectors in a triangle.",
