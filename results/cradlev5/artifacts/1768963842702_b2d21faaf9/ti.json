  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with two intersecting chords, AB and CD, which meet at point E. The task is to find the measure of angle C, given that angle D is 35 degrees and angle AEC is 105 degrees. The sum of angles around point E is 360 degrees, which is a key relation to use. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes labels for angles D, AEC, and C. The exact positions of these angles in the diagram are not described in the text, which may introduce some ambiguity. The problem is multiple-choice, with four options provided for the measure of angle C.",
