  "problem_state_summary": "Linda conducted an experiment where she applied a thin layer of wax to her snowboard and rode it down a hill, then removed the wax and repeated the ride. This process was repeated multiple times, alternating between having wax and not having wax. Her friend Bob timed each ride, and they calculated the average time for rides with wax and without wax. The task is to determine which question the experiment can best answer based on the description provided. The options involve comparing the time it takes for the snowboard to slide down the hill under different wax conditions.",
