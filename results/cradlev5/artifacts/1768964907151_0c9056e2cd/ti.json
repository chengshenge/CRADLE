  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle's dimensions are provided in a diagram, with the length of side AB being 5 cm and the length of side BC being 3 cm. The task is to determine the perimeter using these dimensions. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula 2*(length + width). The dimensions are extracted from the diagram, as they are not provided in the text. The final answer should be an integer value.",
