  "problem_state_summary": "An administrator at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is tracking the average wait time from month to month. The task is to determine the rate of change in average wait time between August and September. This requires extracting data from a table that lists monthly average wait times. The specific values for August and September are needed to compute the rate of change. The rate of change should be expressed in minutes per month. The table provides the necessary data, with August having an average wait time of 80 minutes and September having 85 minutes.",
