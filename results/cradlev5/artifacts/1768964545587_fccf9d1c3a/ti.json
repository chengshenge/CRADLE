  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a scenario where there are a total of 50 objects. Among these, 15 are rubber balls and 10 are yellow shiny things. The task is to subtract the number of rubber balls and yellow shiny things from the total number of objects. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem requires simple arithmetic operations to find the remaining number of objects. The information about the total number of objects, rubber balls, and yellow shiny things is extracted from the image. The final answer should be an integer representing the remaining objects.",
