  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the total volume of a measuring cup based on the image provided. The image contains volume markings in milliliters (ml), which are standard units for volume. The markings on the measuring cup are 250 ml, 500 ml, 750 ml, 1000 ml, 1250 ml, 1500 ml, 1750 ml, and 2000 ml. The task is to identify the total volume of the measuring cup, which is likely the highest marking visible. There is an ambiguity in the problem as the unit is specified as grams (g), which is unusual for volume, suggesting a possible need to interpret the markings correctly. The problem requires reading numbers from the image to determine the total volume of the measuring cup.",
