  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals based on information provided in an image. The image contains text lines that specify the ages of two people: Person 1 is 34 years old, and Person 2 is 28 years old. The task is to calculate the difference between these two ages to find the age gap. The problem requires reading the text from the image to extract the specific ages. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years.",
