  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a square labeled ABCD with an inscribed circle centered at point O. The task is to find the angle ∠AMK. Points M and K are located on sides AB and AD of the square, respectively. However, the exact positions of points M and K are not specified, which introduces ambiguity in determining the angle. The problem requires understanding the geometric properties of the square and the inscribed circle to compute the desired angle. The solution must be provided as a floating-point number with one decimal place.",
