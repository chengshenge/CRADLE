  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram where specific objects are positioned relative to each other. The task is to determine if the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of a brown metal sedan is greater than the number of things to the left of a tiny green bicycle. The problem requires analyzing the spatial relationships between these objects in the diagram. The known elements include the presence of a brown metal sedan, tiny gray bicycles, and a tiny green bicycle. The unknowns are the counts of these objects in specified positions. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: Yes or No.",
