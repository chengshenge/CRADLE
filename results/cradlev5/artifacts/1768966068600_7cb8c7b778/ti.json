  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a square inscribed in a circle. The circle has an area of 18π square units. The task is to find the length of a side of the square. The relationship between the square and the circle is that the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options. The solution requires understanding the geometric relationship between the square and the circle.",
