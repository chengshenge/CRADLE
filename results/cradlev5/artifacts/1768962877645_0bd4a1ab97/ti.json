  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a set of objects, specifically 50 in total, from which certain types need to be subtracted. The task is to subtract the number of large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders from the total number of objects. The image provides the counts for these specific objects: 15 large rubber spheres and 10 big shiny cylinders. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. This is a straightforward arithmetic problem requiring subtraction of known quantities from a total. The final answer should be an integer representing the remaining objects.",
