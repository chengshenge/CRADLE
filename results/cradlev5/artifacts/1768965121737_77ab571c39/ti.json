  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals whose ages are provided in an image. The image contains text lines that specify the ages of the two people: Person 1 is 34 years old and Person 2 is 29 years old. The task is to calculate the difference between these two ages to find the age gap. The problem requires reading the ages from the image and performing a simple arithmetic subtraction. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years.",
