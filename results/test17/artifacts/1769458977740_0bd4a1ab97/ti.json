  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the number of remaining objects after subtracting specific types of objects from a total. The total number of objects is given as 50. There are two types of objects to subtract: large rubber spheres and big shiny cylinders. The number of large rubber spheres is 15, and the number of big shiny cylinders is 10. The task is to subtract these quantities from the total number of objects to find out how many objects are left. The problem requires basic arithmetic operations to compute the final count of remaining objects.",
