  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram is expected to contain geometric shapes and angle labels, specifically marking angle H. According to the information extracted from the diagram, angle H is labeled as 97 degrees. The task is to confirm this measure and map it to the correct multiple-choice option. The problem is straightforward as it involves reading the measure directly from the diagram. The multiple-choice options provide different possible measures for angle H, and the task is to select the correct one based on the diagram's information. The problem is a direct application of geometric principles, specifically reading and interpreting angle measures from a diagram.",
