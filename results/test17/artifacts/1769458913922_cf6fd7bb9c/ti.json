  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle △ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The given information includes the measure of angle ∠A, which is 110°. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠BOC. The problem relies on the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle. The solution requires understanding the relationship between the angles in the triangle and the intersection of the angle bisectors. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options for the measure of angle ∠BOC.",
