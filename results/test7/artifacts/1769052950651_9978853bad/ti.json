  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a bar chart to determine how many bars have values smaller than 6. The chart is titled 'Bar Chart of Values' and has categories labeled on the x-axis and numerical values on the y-axis. The x-axis categories are labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and the y-axis has ticks from 0 to 10. The key points extracted from the chart indicate that the values for these categories are A=5, B=3, C=7, D=2, and E=6. The task is to count the number of bars with values less than 6, which requires reading the chart accurately.",
