  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual analysis of an image containing various objects. The task is to count the total number of objects and then subtract those that are red and those that are tiny matte balls. The goal is to determine how many objects remain after these subtractions. The problem requires identifying objects based on their color and size, which suggests a need for careful visual inspection. The exact definitions of 'tiny' and 'matte' are not provided, which may introduce some ambiguity in the counting process. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
