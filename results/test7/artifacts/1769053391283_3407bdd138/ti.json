  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a food web diagram to determine the impact of a decrease in the large roach population on other species. The food web includes species such as steelheads, stickleback fry, predatory insects, algae, zooplankton, small fish, and birds. Arrows in the diagram indicate the relationships between these species. The task is to predict how the populations of steelheads, stickleback fry, and predatory insects would be affected by the change in the large roach population. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options, each suggesting a different outcome for the populations of these species.",
