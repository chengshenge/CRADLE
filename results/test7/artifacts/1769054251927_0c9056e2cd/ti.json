  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle's dimensions are provided in a diagram, with the length of side AB being 5 cm and the width of side BC being 3 cm. The task is to determine the perimeter using these dimensions. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula 2*(length + width). The problem requires extracting the dimensions from the diagram and applying the formula to find the perimeter. The final answer should be an integer value.",
