  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals whose ages are provided in an image. The image contains text lines that specify the ages of Person 1 and Person 2. The task is to extract these ages and compute the difference between them to find the age gap. The ages are given as 34 years for Person 1 and 29 years for Person 2. The problem requires a simple arithmetic operation to find the difference between these two ages. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years.",
