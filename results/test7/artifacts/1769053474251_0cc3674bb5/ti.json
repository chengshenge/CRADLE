  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a collection of objects with specific attributes such as color, size, and material. The task is to subtract certain groups of objects based on these attributes and determine how many objects remain. Specifically, there are 5 big red metallic spheres and 3 big brown matte things. The total number of objects initially is 20. The goal is to subtract the specified groups from the total and find the remaining count. The problem requires careful reading of the text to identify the correct groups to subtract. The final answer should be an integer representing the number of objects left.",
