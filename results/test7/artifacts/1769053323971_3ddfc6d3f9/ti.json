  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle 3 from a geometric diagram. The diagram is labeled with points A, B, C, and D, and includes several angles. Angle 3 is specifically marked with a value of 38 degrees. The task is to identify the correct measure of angle 3 from the given options. The options provided are 28, 38, 52, and 62 degrees. The problem is a multiple-choice question, and the final answer must be presented as an option label. The context of angle 3 within the diagram is not fully clear without visual inspection.",
