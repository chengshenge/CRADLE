  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the value of r at a specific angle theta, which is 3*pi/2 radians. This suggests a polar plot or graph is involved, where r is plotted as a function of theta. The chart is titled 'Polar Plot of r vs. θ' and has the x-axis labeled as θ (radians) with ticks at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π, and the y-axis labeled as r with ticks at -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. The legend indicates that r is a function of θ. The task is to find the value of r at θ = 3π/2, which is marked on the chart as key point A with r = -1.",
