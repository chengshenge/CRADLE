  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a square ABCD with an inscribed circle centered at O. The task is to find the angle ∠AMK. The diagram is expected to show a square with an inscribed circle, and the labels for points A, B, C, D, O, M, and K are crucial for identifying the geometric configuration needed to determine the angle ∠AMK. The exact positions of points A, M, and K are not specified in the text, which may affect the determination of the angle. The problem requires understanding the geometric configuration of a square and an inscribed circle to determine the angle ∠AMK. The final answer should be a floating-point number with one decimal place.",
