  "problem_state_summary": "A real estate agent has counted the number of houses on each block in a neighborhood. The task is to determine how many blocks have exactly 36 houses. The data is likely presented in a table format, where each row represents a block and the number of houses on that block. The problem requires identifying and counting the blocks that meet the condition of having exactly 36 houses. The table headers are 'Block' and 'Number of Houses', and specific blocks with their corresponding number of houses are listed. The goal is to count the entries in the table where the number of houses is exactly 36.",
