  "problem_state_summary": "Linda and Bob conducted an experiment to determine the effect of wax on the time it takes for a snowboard to slide down a hill. Linda applied a thin layer of wax to her snowboard and timed her descent down the hill. She then removed the wax and repeated the process, alternating between having wax and not having wax on the snowboard. The goal was to calculate the average time for each condition and compare them. The experiment aims to answer a specific question about the effect of wax on the snowboard's performance. The task is to identify which question the experiment is designed to answer based on the given options.",
