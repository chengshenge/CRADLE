  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves understanding the relationship between the number of pelicans and the fish population. It is asked what happens to the fish population if the number of pelicans increases. The text suggests that there is a direct impact of pelicans on fish, likely due to predation. The task is to determine the effect on the fish population based on this relationship. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with four options. The correct answer must be selected from these options.",
