  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing the derivative of a function f(x) at two different points, x=2 and x=5. The task is to determine whether the derivative at x=2 is larger than, equal to, or smaller than the derivative at x=5. The function f(x) is represented graphically, and the derivatives at these points correspond to the slopes of the tangent lines at these points on the graph. The graph includes key points at (2, 1) and (5, -1), and the x-axis and y-axis are labeled with tick marks. The exact values of the derivatives are not provided, requiring interpretation from the graph. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with three options to choose from.",
