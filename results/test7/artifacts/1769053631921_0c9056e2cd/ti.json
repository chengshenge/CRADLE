  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle. The rectangle is depicted in a diagram, and its dimensions are provided within the image. Specifically, the lengths of sides AB and BC are given as 5 cm and 3 cm, respectively. The task is to determine the perimeter using these dimensions. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula 2 * (length + width). The image is crucial as it contains the necessary measurements that are not provided in the text. The final answer should be an integer value representing the perimeter.",
