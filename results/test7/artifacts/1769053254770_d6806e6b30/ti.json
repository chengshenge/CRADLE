  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the impact on the population of adult spiders if all spider eggs are eaten by predators. The scenario is presented in a multiple-choice format, where the reader must deduce the logical outcome of such an event. The question asks what would happen to the adult spider population under the condition that no new spiders can hatch due to the absence of eggs. The options provided suggest various outcomes for the adult spider population, including remaining the same, doubling, decreasing, or increasing. The task requires understanding the life cycle of spiders and the dependency of adult population sustainability on the hatching of new spiders. The problem is purely text-based and does not involve any numerical calculations or visual data interpretation.",
