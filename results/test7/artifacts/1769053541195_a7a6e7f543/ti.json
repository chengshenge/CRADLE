  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure with lines AB and AC. The ratio of the length of line AB to the length of line AC is given as 2:5. The length of line AC is provided as 25 units. The task is to determine the length of line AB using the given ratio. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the length of AB. The solution requires interpreting the ratio and performing a calculation to find the unknown length.",
