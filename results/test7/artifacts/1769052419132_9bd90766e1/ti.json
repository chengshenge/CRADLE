  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves comparing two colors, 'Black' and 'Deep Sky Blue', to determine which one has a greater value. The context is provided by a chart titled 'Color Comparison Chart'. The x-axis of the chart is labeled 'Colors' and includes ticks for 'Black' and 'Deep Sky Blue'. The y-axis is labeled 'Value' with ticks ranging from 0 to 50. According to the chart, 'Black' has a value of 35, while 'Deep Sky Blue' has a value of 25. The task is to decide if 'Black' is greater than 'Deep Sky Blue' based on these values. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: (A) yes and (B) no.",
