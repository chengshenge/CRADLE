  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with two intersecting chords, AB and CD, at point E. The angles ∠D and ∠AEC are given as 35° and 105° respectively. The task is to find the measure of angle ∠C. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes points A, B, C, D, and E, and the intersection of the chords at E. The sum of angles around point E is 360 degrees, which is a key relation to solve the problem. The problem is multiple-choice with four options provided for the measure of angle ∠C.",
