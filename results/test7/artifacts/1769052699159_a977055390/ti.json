  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure, specifically a quadrilateral ABCD. In this figure, it is given that the sides AB and AC are equal, and the angle CAB is 40 degrees. The task is to determine the measure of angle D. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the value of angle D. The type of quadrilateral is not specified, which may affect the calculation of angle D. The diagram is essential for understanding the spatial relationships and verifying the given conditions.",
