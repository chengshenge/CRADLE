  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the measure of angle H from a geometric diagram. The diagram includes labeled points A through H and several known angle measures: m∠A = 45°, m∠B = 90°, m∠C = 135°, m∠D = 150°, m∠E = 60°, m∠F = 75°, and m∠G = 120°. The task is to find the measure of angle H, which is currently unknown. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options. The correct measure of angle H must be selected from these options.",
