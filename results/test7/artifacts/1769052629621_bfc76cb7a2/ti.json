  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual comparison between two groups of objects: 'big red rubber double buss' and 'big green things'. The task is to determine if there are more 'big red rubber double buss' in front of a 'large red double bus' than 'big green things'. This requires identifying and counting these objects in a diagram. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The visual context is crucial as the definitions of the objects are not clear from the text alone. The problem is essentially a logic-based comparison task that relies on visual inspection.",
