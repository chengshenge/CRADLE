  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a circle with center O, where AB is the diameter and CD is a chord. The angle ∠ADC is given as 26 degrees. The task is to find the degree of angle ∠CAB. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes points A, B, C, and D on the circle. The exact positions of these points are not specified in the text, which may affect the interpretation of the diagram. The problem is a multiple-choice question with four options provided for the degree of angle ∠CAB.",
