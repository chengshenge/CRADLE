  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure, specifically a rhombus ABCD. Points E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AD, respectively. The lengths of AB and AC are given as 5 and 6 units. The task is to find the length of segment EF. The problem is presented with a diagram that labels the points and marks the given lengths. The solution requires understanding the properties of a rhombus and using the given information to calculate the length of EF. The problem is multiple-choice, with four options provided for the length of EF.",
