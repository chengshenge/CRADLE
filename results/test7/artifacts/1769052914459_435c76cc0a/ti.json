  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the limit of a function as x approaches -1. The image provided contains a graph of the function, which is essential for analyzing the behavior of the function near x = -1. The x-axis is labeled as 'x' and the y-axis as 'f(x)', with ticks ranging from -3 to 3 on both axes. A key point on the graph is identified at (x, y) = (-1, 2), which is crucial for understanding the function's behavior at x = -1. The task is to find the limit, which must be an integer, based on the graph's information. The problem is a typical calculus question requiring graph analysis to determine the limit.",
