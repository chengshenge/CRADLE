  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram that categorizes objects by color, size, and material. The task is to identify and subtract specific objects based on these attributes. Specifically, the problem requires subtracting all red matte cubes and all small green metal objects. After performing these subtractions, the goal is to determine how many objects are left. The exact number and types of objects are not specified in the text and must be determined from the image. The final answer should be an integer representing the remaining number of objects.",
