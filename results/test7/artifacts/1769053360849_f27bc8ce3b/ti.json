  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves identifying and summing the digits located on either end of a sign in the corner of an image. The task is to read these digits and compute their sum. The image contains text, and the digits '123' and '456' have been extracted from the image. The problem requires determining the sum of these two numbers. The exact location of the 'corner' and the 'sign' is not specified, but it is assumed to be visually identifiable. The task is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations.",
