  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a square inscribed in a circle. The circle has an area of 18π square units. The task is to find the length of a side of the square. The relationship between the circle and the square is crucial, as the square is inscribed within the circle. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with four options. The solution requires understanding the geometric relationship between the circle and the square.",
