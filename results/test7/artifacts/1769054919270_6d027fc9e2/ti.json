  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a chart titled 'Model Performance' to determine which model has the highest accuracy score when the pretrain loss is exactly 1.80. The chart includes a legend with several models: ICL, SFT, SFT 1/8, RFT k=100, RFT k=25, RET k=6, and RFT U13B. The x-axis represents Pretrain Loss with ticks at 1.0, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.5, while the y-axis represents Accuracy Score with ticks at 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95. Key points on the chart indicate the accuracy scores of each model at a pretrain loss of 1.8. The task is to identify the model with the highest accuracy score at this specific pretrain loss value and map it to the corresponding option label.",
