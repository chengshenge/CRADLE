  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a triangle ABC where two angle bisectors, OB and OC, intersect at point O. The angle at vertex A is given as 110 degrees. The task is to find the measure of angle BOC. The problem provides multiple-choice options for the answer. The known information includes the measure of angle A and the fact that OB and OC are angle bisectors. The unknown is the measure of angle BOC. The problem requires understanding the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle to find the solution.",
