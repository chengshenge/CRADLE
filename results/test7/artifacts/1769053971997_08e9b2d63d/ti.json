  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves two diagrams showing pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball in the diagrams represents one gas particle. The task is to compare the average kinetic energies and temperatures of the particles in each sample. Both samples have the same number of particles. The problem asks which sample has the higher temperature, with the understanding that average kinetic energy is related to temperature. The options provided are: neither sample has a higher temperature, sample A has a higher temperature, or sample B has a higher temperature.",
