  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a visual comparison of two groups of objects based on their color and type. Specifically, it asks whether the number of gray rubber objects located in front of a small yellow aeroplane is greater than the number of big cyan matte fighters. The task requires visually identifying and counting these specific objects in a diagram. The problem is presented in a multiple-choice format with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The exact numbers of these objects are not provided in the text and must be determined from the diagram. The problem is essentially a comparison of quantities based on visual inspection.",
