  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a chart titled 'Annual Data Comparison' that displays two lines, Line A and Line B, representing data points over the years 2015 to 2020. The task is to determine which year shows the largest difference in data points between these two lines. The chart has an x-axis labeled 'Year' with ticks for each year from 2015 to 2020, and a y-axis labeled 'Value' with ticks ranging from 0 to 100. The legend identifies the two lines as Line A and Line B. The specific data points for each line are provided for each year. The goal is to compute the difference between the data points of Line A and Line B for each year and identify the year with the maximum difference.",
