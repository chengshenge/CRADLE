  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a diagram that depicts a small metal jet and a tiny sedan, along with other tiny objects. The task is to determine if the number of tiny objects located behind the small metal jet is less than the number of tiny objects situated to the left of the tiny sedan. This requires spatial reasoning to identify and count the relevant objects in the diagram. The problem is presented as a multiple-choice question with two options: 'Yes' or 'No'. The exact definitions of 'behind' and 'left of' are not specified, which may introduce ambiguity in interpreting the diagram.",
