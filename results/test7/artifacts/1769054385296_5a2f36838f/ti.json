  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves analyzing a bar chart titled 'Monthly Sales Data' which displays sales figures for two products, A and B, over the months of January to May. The task is to determine the difference between the largest and smallest bar values in the chart. The chart provides sales data in thousands, with specific values for each product in each month. The largest and smallest bar values need to be identified from the chart, and their difference calculated. The chart includes a legend to distinguish between Product A and Product B, and the Y-axis is labeled with sales values ranging from 0 to 50 in increments of 10. The exact values of the bars are not provided in the prompt but are available in the image.",
