  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric figure known as a Pythagorean tree, which consists of squares and right triangles. In this configuration, all quadrilaterals are squares, and all triangles are right triangles. The areas of two squares, A and B, are provided as 5 and 3 square units, respectively. The task is to determine the area of the largest square, labeled as square C. The relationship between the areas of these squares is governed by the properties of the Pythagorean tree. The problem is presented with multiple-choice options for the area of square C.",
