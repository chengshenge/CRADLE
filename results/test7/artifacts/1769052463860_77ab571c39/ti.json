  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals whose ages are provided in an image. The image contains text that specifies the ages of these two people. The task requires extracting these ages from the image and performing a simple arithmetic operation to find the difference. The ages extracted are 34 years for Person 1 and 29 years for Person 2. The problem asks for the age gap, which is the difference between these two ages. The final answer should be an integer representing the age gap in years.",
