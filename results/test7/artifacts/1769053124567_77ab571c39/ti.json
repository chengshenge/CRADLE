  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves determining the age gap between two individuals whose ages are provided in an image. The image contains text lines that specify the ages of Person 1 and Person 2. The task requires extracting these ages from the image and calculating the difference between them to find the age gap. The ages are given as 25 years for Person 1 and 30 years for Person 2. The problem is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic to compute the absolute difference between the two ages. The final answer should be presented as an integer value representing the age gap in years.",
