  "problem_state_summary": "Chase wants to purchase a total of 9 kilograms of beads, consisting of 4 kilograms of oval beads and 5 kilograms of star-shaped beads. The cost per kilogram for oval beads is $3, and for star-shaped beads, it is $4. The task is to calculate the total expenditure in dollars for these beads. The problem requires basic arithmetic operations to determine the total cost. The final answer should be an integer value representing the total cost in dollars.",
