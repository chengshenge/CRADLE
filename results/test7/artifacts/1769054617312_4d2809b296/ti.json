  "problem_state_summary": "The problem involves a geometric configuration with points A, B, C, and D on a circle labeled O, and point E on the extended line of AD. The angle ∠ABC is given as 60 degrees. The task is to determine the degree of angle ∠CDE. The problem is presented with a diagram that includes these points and angles. The exact position of point E relative to the circle and line AD is not specified, which may affect the interpretation of the diagram. The problem is multiple-choice with four options provided for the degree of angle ∠CDE.",
